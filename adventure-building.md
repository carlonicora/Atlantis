# Building Adventures

While working on the campaign was something you could do without knowing the player characters when you start working on the adventures, you need to have your player characters ready. The best way of writing adventures is to know your player characters and design each adventure around them.

Once you have your campaign master plot laid out, it is time to think about all the great adventures your player characters can live. How are their lives going to interact with your campaign, and how are they going to be an integral part of how the world you prepared is going to be shaped?

We think that the most important thing to understand is that being the Game Master does not need being the one who decides how the history you will be narrating will come out. Your players are as involved in shaping the story as you are, and you should remember this in the way you adapt the adventures on their choices. Remember, always write in pencil and embrace change!

## Type of Adventures in a Campaign

Obviously, the first type of adventures we will discuss is the campaign. We have a campaign with the master plot and a list of adventure ideas. The titles you wrote are the starting point for each of your campaign adventure.

However, you need to understand is that, despite your campaign being the master plot shaping your characters' futures, the adventures linked to the campaign plot are not the only one existing. On the contrary, focussing exclusively on those would rob your players from a lot of fun. Imagine how incredibly strong are the adventures who dig into the characters' past and background. When you take the time to listen to your players and shape the future of their characters based on the back stories they wrote, you create a world they are going to love.

Jinx strongly recommends spending the time to create details backstories for each character. This is done for two main reasons: the first is to help the players bond with their characters, the second is to give storytellers good hooks to create incredibly personal adventures.

## The Story Circle

Jinx is structured to help storytellers write homebrew adventures which are at the same time simple to write and powerful to play. The goal is to provide you with a framework to develop memorable adventures, and to do this we look into the "story circle" idea.

Please keep in mind that this method to create an adventure is based both on a structured and well-known storytelling technique, as well as an easy to use anatomy. It all starts with Dan Harmon's "Story Circle".  Dan Harmond simplified Joseph Campbell "Monomyth" also known as "The Hero's Journey". Dan Harmond divides every story in a circle identified by eight steps. This Story Circle can be applied to every story in every media. Hence it can be used to create amazing adventures whose story will relate to your players.

The reason to use this method is to create stories that will glue your players to the chairs, asking for more. It is the same method scriptwriters use for your favourite films, and while you may not realise it yet, they all follow the same storytelling structure. Jinx has distilled all this information in a simple step-by-step methodology.

However, before describing every step, you should know a bit more about the Story Circle and how it works. You will understand why I try to divide my adventures into four sessions. If you divide the story circle horizontally, the top part is the start and the end of the story, while the bottom part identifies the characters' growth and change. The ordinary versus the special, life versus death, consciousness versus unconsciousness or order versus chaos. If you give the right rhythm to your adventure, this will be felt by your players, as their characters were in a great film. When the characters move from one semicircle to the other, they evolve.
By dividing the story circle vertically as well, you identify four intersections and four spaces.  These are the main parts of our adventures. Every time one of the lines intersect the circle, you define a story point, additionally, between each point, you can identify another story point. With this method, you can identify a total of 8 story points. These points will navigate a hero through their story, piece by piece.

Dan Harmond named each of the 8 points:
1. YOU - A character is in their comfort zone
2. NEED - They want something
3. GO - They enter an unfamiliar situation
4. SEARCH - They adapt to it
5. FIND - Get what they wanted
6. TAKE - pay a heavy price for it
7. RETURN - Then return to their familiar situation
8. CHANGE - Having changed

Every time a character crosses one of the lines, it advances in the story. Each crossing is a major drama point. In point 3 a hero enters an unfamiliar situation and adapts to the new "norm", often struggling to do so. Point 5 define the inner struggle of the hero.

For those of you who are used to the "Three Acts Adventure", the first quadrant identifies the first act, ending with the adventure hook. The second and third quadrant identify the second act, with the midpoint in the middle and the first failed attempt to end it. The last quadrant is the third act, where the heroes win.

But how do you apply Dan Harmond's study to your adventure? Or, to better put it, how do you create a great adventure using Harmond's study?

## Scenes

In many years of storytelling, I have met as many styles of planning an adventure as there are storytellers out there. There isn't a right or a wrong way of doing it. I have decided to write down my planning style.  This is the one that allows me to plan a four hours session of play in details. I don't waste my time writing, yet it allows me to create a consistent story which makes sense for my players.

This way is simple: when I know to intrigue my player characters, I design a list of scenes which may allow the player characters to move from one point to another. I use as many scenes as I need, and each one of them should answer one simple question: why? Why does this scene exist? Is there a purpose for it? If a scene has more than one purpose, I tend to split them in two, but if a scene does not have a purpose, then I either remove it or go back to the drawing board!

## Type of Scenes

In my experience, you can divide Scenes into five main categories:

### GM time

From time to time, you need the space to present something to your players. These are Scenes where there is no interaction with the player characters, but they give you the time to give the player characters a frame of reference or the right amount of information.

*To make this type of Scenes work...* you need to keep them short. It is a recap, it gives you the possibility to set the tone. This does not mean you have to take the stage for half an hour and bore your players to death.

### Planning and Recaps

These are the Scenes in which the player characters discuss amongst themselves. They are extremely important for the players to cement the information they received. You have to remember that the players do not have all the information you have as a Game Master. You have to allow them time for pure roleplay and information analysis. The time for this type of Scenes is extremely variable and depends on your players. One party I had wanted nothing more than a constant, collective brainstorm, investing a huge amount of time in pure discussions. Another was very action-oriented, which meant these Scenes were very short. You need to know about your party!

*To make this type of Scenes work...* you need to give the player characters the time to talk. Give them the right settings, lower the music, make sure that the tone of the game shifts. One non-player character who is there to help them may be good if your players have trouble kickstarting the thought process.

### Exploration

Exploring a new environment can be exciting and can give you time to reorganise the session time, change the adventure on the fly and give something to your player characters. This kind of Scenes' duration is entirely up to you. You can make the are to be explored dry of information, keeping the Scene short, or you can allow your player characters to dissect an entire Star Destroyer piece by piece. Use the exploration Scenes wisely though: make sure your player characters don't get bored and frustrated because they can't find anything.

*To make this type of Scenes work...* you need to define locations very well, then place the ball in the player characters court. Let them tell you what they want to do, and be reactive to them. To be able to be reactive and to provide them with enough information to keep the interest alive, but not too many to conclude the entire Scene in two seconds, you need to know your surroundings. What can they find in each location? Describe what they see and feel so that they are interested in going on exploring. A Dungeon design from the original D&D is the perfect example, just don't limit yourself to an underground cave.

### Action

This type of Scene is about doing something. What I like about it is that they are predictable in terms of results and duration. You should know what's the goal of the action and how much time should it take for you to make the player characters achieve (or fail).

*To make this type of Scenes work...* you should know your location and you should try and consider what a player character may be interested in doing. Give your player characters a series of challenges, without resolving an entire scene with a simple roll. Build the tension and release it over time!

### Social Interaction

My favourite encounters. You can dispense information, taunt your player character, make them fall in love or talk with their archnemesis. Whatever is in your non-player characters arsenal comes through. This is because I am not a fighting-heavy game master, but your miles may vary. The key element for social interaction is the quality of your non-player characters, their three-dimensionality. You are generally in charge of the timing of these situations. Like in any situation in which you are the person timing it, make sure not to stretch it too much or making it too dry. If you are an inexperienced game master, give yourself time.

*To make this type of Scenes work...* your non-player characters have to be well designed. They have to be three dimensional, they must have character and things to say. Try to think about your non-player characters before the Scene, so that you know how they behave and how they can react. You can find more information on how to create a great non-player character later in the book.

### Combat

While I am not a fighting-heavy game master, I still believe that combat situations are great to keep the level of excitement elevated. There is nothing better than a spike of adrenaline to shake a soporiferous session. But please, remember that even your monsters are non-player characters, give them a three-dimensional feel to it. This is why I despise random encounters: because they have no reason to exist apart from having a useless fight.

*To make this type of Scenes work...* you must know how to fight! Your non-player characters or monsters must have a plan, or if they don't, you must know they don't (but that should be a plan nonetheless). Remember the Assumption of Heroism and make sure the foes do what they can to play their part. One thing many storytellers seem to forget is that non-player characters or monsters may not be interested in dying, and they may well think to flee if they see the worse come to worst!

### Location

Yes, some scenes are just locations. The player characters should be able to explore the place they are in, maybe there are hidden secrets to discover, maybe there is something happening in the room they are in. Sometimes it is just a place where they find something they need.

*To make this type of Scenes work...*

## The Anatomy of a Scene

Before going to understand how an adventure is built, I want to point out how a scene is built. This because an adventure will use scenes, so it is good to understand how to build those. Without further ado, let's look into it and see how a single scene can be created.

Apart from the type of the scene and its title, you will find that the rule of the five Ws applies to the scenes. Why, When, Where, Who, What and How. Answering these simple questions will give a great overview of each scene.

Before digging deeper into this, I would like to underline two things. The first is about how to write a scene, the second is about the scene's flexibility. The way a storyteller write a scene depends on their style. I like bullet points, they make my life simple when I write the scene and easily accessible when I play. I don't like to read from a document, so I don't add any particular text to read to my players. Having bullet points allow me quick access to whatever should already be in my brain. As for the scene flexibility, you should remember that a scene may well be wiped out by the player characters actions in the previous scene. Remember, not because you invested time in it, your players should love it. Write in pencil and make sure you allow your mind to conceive the fact that the story is built with your players, not without.

### Title

Hey, this may sound silly, but a one-liner to remind you what the scene is without reading for more than a second is invaluable. You can write it at the beginning, to help you dig deeper, or you can do it at the end when you know exactly what's happening in the scene. That's up to you.

@TODO EXAMPLE

### Type

Few pages back, I mentioned you can have many types of scenes. This single line just tells me what to expect.

@TODO EXAMPLE

### Why

This is the golden point for every scene, and the "*sine qua non*", the indispensable thing without which the scene is not a scene: its purpose for the player characters! What is the reason for the scene to exist? Why are you considering making your player characters live it? Even simple combat should have a purpose!

The purpose should be specific and clear to you. Something like "*the player characters should learn something about something else*" won't do any good. You, the storyteller, should always be in the know.

@TODO EXAMPLE

### When

Now, here I cheated a bit with the Five Ws. In the "when", I write the playing time I set up for this scene. This is a number which helps me plan a session well. To write numbers that make sense, you need to understand your players well.

@TODO EXAMPLE

### Where

The location is the place where the scene takes place. In some occasion, the location **is** the scene. Give it flavour, give it character. How does it look and feel? If you want to draw a map, do it. Or if you, like me, are a "*theatre of the mind*" storyteller, just make it juicy in the way you tell it.

@TODO EXAMPLE

### Who

Who is present in the scene apart from the player characters? Here is where I put together a list of non-player characters and eventually monsters. I just put their names, but before playing I will make sure I have more details for each of those I named.

@TODO EXAMPLE

### What

The "what" are the information or things the player character may learn or get from the scene. I say "may" because player characters are renown to have a mind of their own. From time to time they miss the elephant in the room, just because they are too focused on what their agenda is.

@TODO EXAMPLE

### How

Last, but not least, here I write a bullet points of everything I need to define the scene. Short, to the point, and without any writing skills required.

Please try and keep in mind that the more natural you are in front of your players, the more they will enjoy the game. If you read from a piece of paper, you lose part of the magic you are creating. Writing a short list of elements, sometimes tags that allow you to describe something in an incredible way, is more than enough. Sometimes it is fine to write a direct discussion, as long as it is short.

@TODO EXAMPLE

## The Anatomy of an Adventure

You have seen how I create an adventure and -hopefully- you haven't lost the main logic behind it. To create the adventure you read it took me 15', plus writing time. In the writing time, I managed to write a few more details.

Let's now go to a step-by-step point to create your own adventure!

### Adventure Main Questions

1. What is the goal of the adventure?
2. Why do the player characters need to achieve this goal?
3. How are they going to achieve it?

### Turning Points

1. What is the final realisation/turn of Scenes which can lead the player characters to achieve their goals? (point 7)
2. How are the player characters achieve their goals? (point 8)
3. What is the decision the player characters make that defines the moment they move from being a secondary actor to being in charge? (point 5)
4. What turn of Scenes makes them attempt a solution which will fail? (point 6)
5. What is the change they accept to embark in the adventure? (point 3)
6. What is the burning need they have to feel for the hook to work? (point 2)
7. What changes that give them the possibility to get closer to accepting they are the primary actors in charge of the adventure? (point 4)
8. What is the start of the adventure?

### Scenes

1. What is the "normal life" and how do you do to make the player characters to feel a burning Need? (between points 1 and 2)
2. How do you enhance the need, making the player characters say YES to your adventure? (between points 2 and 3)
3. What is the first part of the adventure which makes them the player characters feel confident? (between points 3 and 4)
4. What do the Player Characters go through to make them feel very low, reaching the point they decide to truly commit to an internal change that will give them power? (between points 4 and 5)
5. What do the players do to prepare to win what they perceive to be the most important battle? (between points 5 and 6)
6. What is that the player characters fails so spectacularly that they have to re-think their goals? (between points 6 and 7)
7. Now the player characters regroup and win. What happens to give them this possibility? (between points 7 and 8)
8. What do you do to show your player characters the appreciative pat on the back for their victory? (after point 8)

### Sessions

Don't you crave a new episode of a TV series when the end of the previous leaves you on a cliffhanger? The only thing you think is: I want to know how this is going to end. This emotional value is a key element in keeping the interest alive and the commitment high. And let's not forget, you are dealing with characters your players have created and love.

There is simple magic to create this aura of suspension in your adventures. You have to know when to stop the sessions. Luckily for you, using this method, creating cliffhangers is very simple. We mentioned before that there are three points where the characters cross a line in the circle: when they decide to embark in the adventure in point number 3; when they take responsibility for being the drivers of the adventure in point number 5; and when they decide to return to their familiar situation by facing the odds and winning the day in point 7. Each of these points defines a cliffhanger in the story, and if you time your sessions well, at the end of each session you will leave your players craving for more. At the end of session one, they will be excited because they are ready to solve their needs. At the end of session two, they will understand they need to lead the story. At the end of session three, they will probably fear for the

@TODO

## Location, Location, Location

While the Story Circle is an amazing tool to narrate a story, life as a storyteller has one difference: your players. They will live your stories and they will shape them, or at least your goal should be to allow them to shape them. A linear story will give you enough information to be a good storyteller, but to get one step forward, it is time to talk about locations.

In the world you describe to your players, more often than not locations will play a very important role. Not only you can characterise your story through them, but they usually are the place where object, clues or non-player characters reside. If you go back to the original role-playing game, Dungeons and Dragons, the idea was to design a dungeon. In every room, you would place objects, traps or monsters, and that was the game.

Writing your locations in details, including all the information about how they are relevant to your characters and to your story, allows you to bring a better three-dimensionality to your world. Moreover, and this is maybe even more important, will transform your linear story in a free-floating one without the need to change your adventure. What if your player characters decide to go in the Inn before exploring the castle? What if they decide to avoid the first village, but they go directly in the woods? Including all the information about your locations in the adventure will allow you to shift even further from railroading.

The best option you have while writing your adventure is to make note of all the locations your player characters can come in touch with during a session. After having written your adventure, you should list all the locations and add the information about what the player characters can find who they can meet in them. Of course, some encounters can only happen linearly, so stay flexible!


## Think linearly, expand logically, improvise organically and re-write constantly

One common comment I get when I tell how I structure an adventure is that I write linearly. While this is absolutely true, the misconception is that a linear structure leads to a railroad adventure. This is not true if you stick to four main pillars:

1. **Think Linearly**. Your adventure should be written in a linear way. You should plan a structure that goes from point to point.
2. **Expand Logically**. Once you have a linear structure of an adventure, you need to start looking at all the moments in which the player characters' interaction may change the direction of an adventure.
3. **Improvise Organically**. During the game, you should be ready to improvise based on your player characters' actions.
4. **Re-write Constantly**. After each session, you should go back to the drawing board and change the linear structure to adapt to the player characters' decisions.

Using these four steps, I can guarantee you will be able to plan adventures which are going to rock your players' world, without making them feel directed in a specific direction. This is neither Railroading nor Sandboxing, this is just being a good storyteller!

## Timing

One of my personal mistakes was that I was always trying to cram too many things in a single session. I wanted my the characters to do too much in a 3 hours session. This was causing the players often to be puzzled on what happened. I was going too fast, and they weren't able to appreciate the game. So, my personal target became to plan fewer things, to make stories a bit lighter and blander.

Try and understand your players as much as you can. When you start timing each Scene correctly, then you will learn how to make your plots more entertaining, without overrunning.

Also, knowing your players well, and realising what they appreciate the most, may help you changing the ratio of the adventure, maybe making the first part spanning over two sessions (this is rare) or the ending one lasting longer (easier).

## About the length of your writing

Writing a lot of text is simple, but the art of summarising things is one of the most challenging things. However, I have always disliked storytellers who read during the game. I have always thought that every encounter can be summarised in a few bullet points, which are easy to digest during the game.

The end result should, therefore, be a very short, readable text.

@TODO

This is what you should have in front of you during the game. However, the process of creating an adventure can go through some serious writing. This is absolutely fine because it will give you the background information which will help you run the game smoothly!
