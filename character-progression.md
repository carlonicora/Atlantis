# Character Progression

In Jinx, character progresses by growing their abilities through experience and repetition. When the player characters use any ability, they should mark them. At the end of each session, each player character can try and raise the ability level.

In order to improve their abilities, player characters have to roll a d100 and score higher than their current ability skill. If a character has successfully used an ability more than once, every success after the first gives them a bonus of +10 to the roll. The amount of progression of each ability depends on the success score of the roll.

'success = d100 + bonus - current ability value'

## Progression steps

A player character who successfully increase the value of ability will add a set of points based on the table below.

Progression success|Ability increase
---|---
1-10|+1
11-25|+2
26-35|+3
36+|+5
