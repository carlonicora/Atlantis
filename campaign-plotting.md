# Plotting Campaigns

## Always start with the end in mind

A very important element while writing campaigns and adventures, you need to start from the end. If you are planning an epic campaign, the first thing you should start writing is the end. Considering how things turn out makes it easier to plan how they started.

## Plotting a Campaign

The main idea behind a great campaign is simple: you should be able to create a compelling, detailed background plot. Now, what many storytellers don't understand about a campaign is that its plot is neither about the player characters nor it is the story the player characters will go through. While this may sound strange, especially after I mentioned that everything should be around your player and their characters, you need to realise one thing. Your player characters only exist in a world, and the way you allow them to live is to have a world which can live without them. The campaign is your world without the player characters. It is the background upon which they will become heroes of villains. If you have this plot, you can allow them to interact with an exciting world.

Moreover, when you consider this plot, we find it is always best to write it from a villain perspective. While you can write a plot from the perspective of an ally, this does not give your player characters enough interesting spots to interact with the plot. The campaign is, therefore, a long story arc about a villain and what they want to achieve.

Put your thinking cap on, forget any player and start planning what your world will go through in the next months.

## The master plot

The master plot is a simple sentence that identifies, without describing any details, the main villain and its goal.

> Lord Enoch wants to gain the throne of the Empire of Wardwore by either buying the support of the high council or killing those who oppose him.

Don't expect your master plot to tell you more than what's necessary. Your first plot does not have to be interesting. A master plot is just the baseline of what the world will go through.

## The story is a collection of information

Another common pitfall some storytellers make is to think that they can grow the story and learn about it at the same time the players do. This is a common mistake you can sort quickly. Imagine yourself as the writer of an intriguing spy story. You, the writer, must know everything about the story. Starting to write the novel without knowing the ins and outs, the who's who is a path to failure. In the same way, as a storyteller, you should know everything concerning your campaign.

## Know everything and everyone in your plot

Now that your master plot is ready, it is time to put it in context. This means starting reading your master plot stopping and clarifying, every time you can, the following:

- What
- Who
- Where
- When
- How

This means that starting from the main plot, every time you meet a detail which is not clear enough about which you could answer one or the magic questions above, you should write a bit more. Consider also that the answers you will give may contain other details you should clarify. This becomes a '*fishbone*' set of answers which will help you describe your campaign in great details.

Let's start analysing our master plot, stopping every time a detail can be clarified.

@TODO

`Lord Enoch` (Ok, who is he? Where does he live? What does he stand for? How has he gained power?) `wants to gain the throne of the Empire of Wardwore` (wait, what is the Empire of Wardwore? How is it ruled? Who is the current Emperor? Where is it in the world? Who are the main figures in it?) `by either buying` (How do the money he has come from? How much money does he have? Where does he keep them? When did he gain them?) `the support of the high council` (What is the High Council? How does it work? Who is in charge of it? Who is in it? How does the Emperor treat the High Council? When was it formed?) `or killing those who oppose him` (Who want to oppose him? Why do they want to fight him? How many there are? How is he going to kill them?)

The questions we asked in this example are only a minimal part of those we should ask. You need to ask as many questions as possible, and you also have to start asking the same questions when you get your first answers. Let's say that one of the members of the High Council who is going to oppose Lord Enoch is Lady Elgolath. You need to start asking the same questions about her.

By starting from a single master plot and by exploring all the details will begin creating your world in minute details. This is what you want because by spending a few hours (or a few days) on refining the initial plot, you will detail your world so much so that moving forward and starting to plan how your player characters will interact with it will be simple.

## How to make a campaign come to life

A campaign, for what you have written so far, is just a master plot with a lot of details. It is time to start planning how to make this come to life and how to let player characters interact with it. I know that for many people this is going to be a let-down, but a campaign is just a list of adventures. And not complete adventures, but adventures plots. Once you have the master plot, you need to ask yourself: what are the steps the main villain or their henchmen need to go through in order to succeed?

Remember, what you need to write are just a set of titles and some notes to make you remember what the title is about!

Let's make things simple and bring back Lord Enoch, always remembering to start from the end.

Obviously, the last part of the campaign is when Lord Enoch wins. The coronation is the obvious finale should everything go as he wishes! This is the last moment in which someone willing to oppose him can stop the madness of such a man becoming Emperor.

> Lord Enoch coronation

A man like him is sure to be willing to send a clear message to everyone who dares to oppose his power. As we said that Lady Elgolath is clearly against him, what about having her publicly executed for something wrong she has done?

> The execution of Lady Elgolath

Lady Elgolath has done something wrong, but seen that Lord Enoch is still not the Emperor, he must have been careful to pass things as very legal so Lady Elgolath could have gone through a trial before being executed.

> The treason trial

What if Lady Elgolath was betrayed by an old friend who was bought by Lord Enoch? This can be an interesting twist of Scenes.

> Betraying the high council

Let's say that to gain power, Lord Enoch had to eliminate two adversaries? One is Lady Elgolath, maybe the other is called Lord Mutwen. Hey, let's say that he "was" called Lord Mutwen.

> Murder on the hill

Before starting to eliminate those who are against him, Lord Enoch must have hired an assassin.

> Hiring the assassin

And before that, Lord Enoch must have gained a large sum of money to support his work.

> Breaking in the Imperial Coinage

We have always considered the campaign from when Lord Enoch started pulling all the strings, but maybe before that, he wanted to make sure that his name was high up in the list of the possible successors to the throne. Maybe a lavish party where politics were drawn.

> The Mid Summer Ball



## Write in pencil

One of the challenges I see in some campaigns or adventures, is that they are written in stone. As the storyteller has invested time in creating their campaigns or adventures, they expect the player characters to follow them precisely. This is where the idea of "Railroading" comes in, and where campaigns and adventures stop being fun to play.

However you believe your campaigns or Adventures will be played, your player characters will find a way to do things you haven't considered, derailing your great plans. Remember, this is how it is supposed to be. Your players have the same ability to shape the story you have. They play their characters for specific reasons, and you cannot expect them to behave like characters in a book. The only place where it happens are books, and if you expect it, you should rather write a novel than be a storyteller.

You should write everything in pencil, at least in your mind. This means, be ready to change your mind over and over again. This mental attitude will help you be a better storyteller.

One of the most crucial aspects of plotting a campaign is to understand that everything you are writing now is just an idea. You still don't know your player characters, their backstories and their dreams. You have no idea how their future actions will impact the villain's plot. This is why your plot and its collection of adventures should still be just an idea. You will change your plot adventures ideas many times, and you should understand that this is the life of a good campaign. There is nothing worse than a game master who can't conceive that their players may not be interested in the order of Scenes.

Remember the golden rule of a good game master. You must embrace change for your players' sake. While you will spend hours plotting and writing, it is their prerogative to decide how to interact with your creation. Trying to force a story down your player's throat is merely wrong.
