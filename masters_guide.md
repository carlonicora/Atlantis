## Introduction

Welcome to Jinx, a role-playing game which will help you dream and realise beautiful stories for and with your players. This RPG is based on two defining factors: rules simplicity and good storytelling.
Rules simplicity means that you, as the game master, should be able to focus more on creating and narrating a story, more than checking books.
The idea of good storytelling is achieved not by connecting the rules system to the storytelling in itself. It does it by simplifying the way you can create campaigns and adventures, helping you tailoring them around your players.

Jinx has been written with a long experience in running role-playing game campaigns. This means we have made a lot of mistakes, and in the process, we have learned a thing or two. This book does not require you to know anything about role-playing games. What we stand for is practice. Even if you have never run your own campaign, just do it. This is how we moved from throwing Kobolds to our player characters to making them oversee worlds under their dominion. However, if you are an experienced game master, we ask you to read this book with an open mind. We may not express the world as you see it, but we hope to give you at least a good tip or two.

### What is a Role-Playing Game


### Setting

While Jinx is designed to support multiple universes, this main guide is written with an epic fantasy campaign in mind.

### Example of play


## How to be a good storyteller

You may have noticed that this guide is called the "Master Guide". This has two meanings. The first is that this book is the main book for Jinx. The second is that this book is written explicitly with the game master in mind. We think that it is the master's responsibility to know the game's mechanics. They are the element of uncertainty that can build tension. As long as you know the rules well enough, your players will enjoy.

The idea of being a "good storyteller" boils down to be able to create world and stories your players are going to love. If your players can't stop talking about what happened in the last episode and they come back for more, you know you are doing a great job.

### Sandboxing or Railroading?

Online it is easy to find a holy war raging between supporters of sandboxing game and "railroaders". Jinx is neither but sits in the middle. A campaign well plotted and a flexible approach to adventures, which keeps into consideration the players as the most essential elements of a role-playing game, is what Jinx supports. In realising that both sides have pro and con, Jinx takes an approach which enhances storytelling and fun. Please do remember that in role-playing games there are no winning conditions, there is fun.

If you are new to the terms "sandboxing" and "railroading", then you have an advantage, as you won't have to forget what you have learned. However, should you be a strong supporter of one or the other, the advice we can give you is to open your mind and read this book. If, then, you'll feel that your way is the right way, by any means, please do play as you love. What we know is that every game master, dungeon master or storyteller has their own fabulous way of running a game. The important thing is to do it.

### The differences between a storyteller and a player

Apart from the obvious (player proposes, storyteller approves), there are vast differences between being a storyteller and being a player. As a player you are the hero, you will fight, and you will -hopefully- win. Your character will wander the world and will leave a visible mark in its history. If you are a storyteller, though, your role is one of the unsung heroes, of the stableboy and of the villain. And the challenge is that you will have to plan it all. You can undoubtedly improvise once or twice, but if your world is not well thought through, or if your characters do not convey a story continuity, you will fail your players.

Game masters will spend hours on hours designing a city, a dungeon, a player character or a story. We will write a lot of ideas which we end up trashing because the player won't take our adventure hook. We will create the perfect NPC, trying their voice in front of the mirror, just to have them killed by a PC with low self-control. However, you can look at the same thing realising that you are the narrator which creates a world your player want to return to. You are all the Gods the player characters invoke in their prayers and the beautiful elves they will fall for.

Another difference is that while players expect to be entertained, you will have to provide the entertainment, selflessly. When your player characters win, you win. When your players have fun, you will.

### The golden rule of a good game master

A good game master is the one that is able to make their player characters interact with and shape a story which everyone love.

This means that your role of unsung hero will require you to change your plots, stories, ideas and expectations. Become comfortable with changes, because that's the only way you can be a good game master.

## Campaigns

### Plotting a Campaign

The main idea behind a great campaign is simple: you should be able to create a compelling, detailed background plot. Now, what many game masters don't understand about a campaign is that its plot is neither about the player characters nor it is the story the player characters will go through. While this may sound strange, especially after I mentioned that everything should be around your player and their characters, you need to realise one thing. Your player characters only exist in a world, and the way you allow them to live is to have a world which can live without them. The campaign is your world without the player characters. It is the background upon which they will become heroes of villains. If you have this plot, you can allow them to interact with an exciting world.

Moreover, when you consider this plot, we find it is always best to write it from a villain perspective. While you can write a plot from the perspective of an ally, this does not give your player characters enough interesting spots to interact with the plot.

Put your thinking cap on, forget any player and start planning what your world will go through in the next months.

### The master plot
A plot is a simple sentence that identifies, without describing, the main villain and its goal.

```
Lord Enoch wants to gain the throne of the Empire of Wardwore by either buying the support of the high council or killing those who oppose him.
```

Don't expect your master plot to tell you more than what's necessary. Your first plot does not have to be interesting. A master plot is just the baseline of what the world will go through.

### The story is a collection of tasks

Once the main plot is complete, and all the elements in it are transparent, it is time to list everything the villain needs to do to succeed. This is where your player characters start to interact with the plot and the world at large. Each and every step the villain must achieve to win the long term plot are going to be the adventures your player characters may participate in.

### Know everything and everyone in your plot

Now that your master plot is ready, it is time to put it in context. This means starting reading your master plot stopping and clarify, every time you can, the following:
- What
- Who
- Where
- When
- How

This means that you should start noting down every detail you have in your mind and every detail you haven't yet considered. Start reading your master plot, and every time you find a word, ask yourself if you can expand on it by answering the five questions above.

`Lord Enoch` (Ok, who is he? Where does he live? What does he stand for? How has he gained power?) `wants to gain the throne of the Empire of Wardwore` (wait, what is the Empire of Wardwore? How is it ruled? Who is the current Emperor? Where is it in the world? Who are the main figures in it?) `by either buying` (How do the money he has come from? How much money does he have? Where does he keep them? When did he gain them?) `the support of the high council` (What is the High Council? How does it work? Who is in charge of it? Who is in it? How does the Emperor treat the High Council? When was it formed?) `or killing those who oppose him` (Who want to oppose him? Why do they want to fight him? How many there are? How is he going to kill them?)

The questions we asked in this example are only a minimal part of those we should ask. You need to ask as many questions as possible, and you also have to start asking the same questions when you get your first answers. Let's say that one of the members of the High Council who is going to oppose Lord Enoch is Lady Elgolath. You need to start asking the same questions about her.

By starting from a single master plot and by exploring all the details will begin creating your world in minute details. This is what you want because by spending a few hours (or a few days) on refining the initial plot, you will detail your world so much so that moving forward and starting to plan how your player characters will interact with it will be simple.

### A plot is a long term plan written in pencil

One of the most crucial aspects of plotting a campaign is to understand that everything you are writing now is just an idea. You still don't know your player characters, their backstories and their dreams. You have no idea how their future actions will impact the villain's plot. This is why your plot and its collection of adventures must be written in pencil. You will change your plot adventures ideas many times, and you should understand that this is the life of a good campaign. There is nothing worse than a game master who can't conceive that their players may not be interested in the order of events.

Remember the golden rule of a good game master. You must embrace change for your players' sake. While you will spend hours plotting and writing, it is their prerogative to decide how to interact with your creation. Trying to force a story down your player's throat is merely wrong. If you want to be in total control of your world and its lore, write a book, because becoming a game master won't be fun, for you nor for your players.

You should start writing the titles of each of these tasks. As before, you should do it in pencil, ready to change everything once your player characters begin to interact with your world. The number of adventures you need to plot is not a fixed number and depends on how long you want your campaign to last. I generally spend four gaming sessions for each adventure. Playing once a week, this means that each adventure spans one month of play. Considering I mix one adventure related to the master plot to one unrelated to it, this means that if you plan twelve master plot adventures, you expect your campaign to last two full years.

That said, I like to write a few more adventures than strictly necessary. I do it because I know that my player characters will manage to interact with the master plot so much that they will change the shape of the story.

### Multiple Plots
If you want to create a world your players will find multi-faceted and complete, you only need to write more than one plot which interacts between each other. While this may sound simple, at least once you master the logic behind how to create a plot, the complexity of multiple plots is exponentials. The number of non-player characters, how they interact with each other and how these plots will interact together, can be overwhelming. I suggest this approach only if you have mastered the base plot exceptionally well and you have a group of players ready to embark on an epic, long journey.

## Adventures

Once you have your campaign master plot laid out, it is time to think about all the great adventures your player characters can live. How are their lives going to interact with your campaign, and how are they going to be an integral part of how the world you prepared is going to be shaped?

We think that the most important thing to understand is that being the Game Master does not need being the one who decides how the history you will be narrating will come out. Your players are as involved in shaping the story as you are, and you should remember this in the way you adapt the adventures on their choices. Remember, always write in pencil and embrace change!

### Type of Adventures in a Campaign

#### Campaign adventures

#### Other adventures

The first thing you need to understand is that, despite your campaign being the master plot shaping your characters' futures, the campaign linked to the campaign plot is not the only one existing. On the contrary, focussing exclusively on those would rob your players from a lot of fun. Imagine how incredibly strong are the adventures who dig into the characters' past and background. When you take the time to listen to your players and shape the future of their characters based on the back stories they wrote, you create a world they are going to love.

### The Story Circle
Please keep in mind that this method to create an adventure is based both on a structured and well-known storytelling technique, as well as an easy to use anatomy. It all starts with Dan Harmon's "Story Circle".  Dan Harmond simplified Joseph Campbell "Monomyth" also known as "The Hero's Journey".
Dan Harmond divides every story in a circle identified by eight steps. This Story Circle can be applied to every story in every media. Hence it can be used to create amazing adventures whose story will relate to your players.

Before describing every step, let me dig a bit deeper in the circle and how it can be divided. You will understand why I try to divide my adventures into four sessions. If you divide the story circle horizontally, the top part is the start and the end of the story, while the bottom part identifies the characters' growth and change. The ordinary versus the special, life versus death, consciousness versus unconsciousness or order versus chaos. If you give the right rhythm to your adventure, this will be felt by your players, as their characters were in a great film. When the characters move from one semicircle to the other, they evolve.
By dividing the story circle vertically as well, you identify four intersections and four spaces.  These are the main parts of our adventures. Every time one of the lines intersect the circle, you define a story point, additionally, between each point, you can identify another story point. With this method, you can identify a total of 8 story points. These points will navigate a hero through their story, piece by piece.

Dan Harmond named each of the 8 points:
1. YOU - A character is in their comfort zone
2. NEED - They want something
3. GO - They enter an unfamiliar situation
4. SEARCH - They adapt to it
5. FIND - Get what they wanted
6. TAKE - pay a heavy price for it
7. RETURN - Then return to their familiar situation
8. CHANGE - Having changed

Every time a character crosses one of the lines, it advances in the story. Each crossing is a major drama point. In point 3 a hero enters an unfamiliar situation and adapts to the new "norm", often struggling to do so. Point 5 define the inner struggle of the hero.

For those of you who are used to the "Three Acts Adventure", the first quadrant identifies the first act, ending with the adventure hook. The second and third quadrant identify the second act, with the midpoint in the middle and the first failed attempt to end it. The last quadrant is the third act, where the heroes win.

But how do you apply Dan Harmond's study to your adventure? Or, to better put it, how do you create a great adventure using Harmond's study?

### Write your adventures in pencil!
Please remember that writing an adventure is not the same as writing a novel. The main characters are not NPCs you control, but your players that move their character in the world you produce. They will break your beautifully crafted adventure and will do things you didn't consider. That is good! However, keep that in mind and don't invest 10 hours in writing an adventure. Detail the adventure as you saw me do in the previous part, and start adding details, like NPCs, only session by session. Your adventure is divided into four sessions, don't write the details of the second one before you have played the first: in this way you will be able to change things to make the second session even more interesting!

One more piece of advice: listen to your players. It is quite common for them to say things, sometimes inadvertently, that may give your adventure an amazing future spin. Don't be afraid of re-writing the adventure plots after each session. Doing so will make you a better storyteller.

### The Anatomy of an Adventure

You have seen how I create an adventure and -hopefully- you haven't lost the main logic behind it. To create the adventure you read it took me 15', plus writing time. In the writing time, I managed to write a few more details.

Let's now go to a step-by-step point to create your own adventure!

#### Adventure Main Questions
1. What is the goal of the adventure?
2. Why do the PCs need to achieve this goal?
3. How are they going to achieve it?

#### Turning Points
1. What is the final realisation/turn of events which can lead the PCs to achieve their goals? (point 7)
2. How are the PCs achieve their goals? (point 8)
3. What is the decision the PCs make that defines the moment they move from being a secondary actor to being in charge? (point 5)
4. What turn of events makes them attempt a solution which will fail? (point 6)
5. What is the change they accept to embark in the adventure? (point 3)
6. What is the burning need they have to feel for the hook to work? (point 2)
7. What changes that give them the possibility to get closer to accepting they are the primary actors in charge of the adventure? (point 4)
8. What is the start of the adventure?

#### Events
1. What is the "normal life" and how do you do to make the player characters to feel a burning Need? (between points 1 and 2)
2. How do you enhance the need, making the PCs say YES to your adventure? (between points 2 and 3)
3. What is the first part of the adventure which makes them the PCs feel confident? (between points 3 and 4)
4. What do the Player Characters go through to make them feel very low, reaching the point they decide to truly commit to an internal change that will give them power? (between points 4 and 5)
5. What do the players do to prepare to win what they perceive to be the most important battle? (between points 5 and 6)
6. What is that the player characters fails so spectacularly that they have to re-think their goals? (between points 6 and 7)
7. Now the player characters regroup and win. What happens to give them this possibility? (between points 7 and 8)
8. What do you do to show your player characters the appreciative pat on the back for their victory? (after point 8)

##### Type of Events
In my experience, you can divide events into five main categories:

- **GM time** From time to time, you need the space to present something to your players. These are events where there is no interaction with the PCs, but they give you the time to give the PCs a frame of reference or the right amount of information.

- **Planning and Recaps** These are the events in which the player characters discuss amongst themselves. They are extremely important for the players to cement the information they received. You have to remember that the players do not have all the information you have as a Game Master. You have to allow them time for pure roleplay and information analysis. The time for these type of events is extremely variable and depends on your players. One party I had wanted nothing more than a constant, collective brainstorm, investing a huge amount of time in pure discussions. Another was very action-oriented, which meant these events were very short. You need to know about your party!

- **Exploration** Exploring a new environment can be exciting and can give you time to reorganise the session time, change the adventure on the fly and give something to your player characters. This kind of events' duration is entirely up to you. You can make the are to be explored dry of information, keeping the event short, or you can allow your player characters to dissect an entire Star Destroyer piece by piece. Use the exploration events wisely though: make sure your PCs don't get bored and frustrated because they can't find anything.

- **Action** This type of event is about doing something. What I like about it is that they are predictable in terms of results and duration. You should know what's the goal of the action and how much time should it take for you to make the PCs achieve (or fail).

- **Encounter** Here we land in the most exciting types of events: the player characters interact with other NPCs. Of course, you can divide an encounter into two different categories: social interactions or combat situations.

  - **Social Interactions** my favourite encounters. You can dispense information, taunt your player character, make them fall in love or talk with their archnemesis. Whatever is in your NPCs arsenal comes through. This is because I am not a fighting-heavy game master, but your miles may vary. The key element for social interaction is the quality of your NPCs, their three-dimensionality. You are generally in charge of the timing of these situations. Like in any situation in which you are the person timing it, make sure not to stretch it too much or making it too dry. If you are an inexperienced game master, give yourself time.

  - **Combat** While I am not a fighting-heavy game master, I still believe that combat situations are great to keep the level of excitement elevated. There is nothing better than a spike of adrenaline to shake a soporiferous session. But please, remember that even your monsters are NPCs, give them a three-dimensional feel to it. This is why I despise random encounters: because they have no reason to exist apart from having a useless fight.

Now that we have explored the types of events you can fill your story with, let's go back to our examples so I can show my thought process.

#### NPCs and Locations
Once your adventure is plotted and defined, it is time to give it a three-dimensional flavour. It is time for you to add some magic by defining your NPCs and the Locations they live in. My suggestion is to go through all the events of a Session and start defining which are the NPCs and the Locations the PCs will encounter.

As I am a believer in examples, I will expand the Star Wars adventure I have used previously.

### Footnotes on the anatomy of an adventure

No matter if your adventure is part of your campaign plot, of it is an in-between story, each adventure should follow the same anatomy. By reading around, you will find various methods and logic behind "how to create an adventure". In here you will see our own take, based on experience and on the need to simplify the way we create them.

The first part of this chapter will dig into why I work with this method. It will tell you more about the reason and history of the story circle. If you are more interested in the nitty-gritty way of creating great adventures, just skip to the part where we say how to apply the story circle to an adventure and how to create one.

#### Splitting the adventure into sessions

Don't you crave a new episode of a TV series when the end of the previous leaves you on a cliffhanger? The only thing you think is: I want to know how this is going to end. This emotional value is a key element in keeping the interest alive and the commitment high. And let's not forget, you are dealing with characters your players have created and love.

There is simple magic to create this aura of suspension in your adventures. You have to know when to stop the sessions. Luckily for you, using this method, creating cliffhangers is very simple. We mentioned before that there are three points where the characters cross a line in the circle: when they decide to embark in the adventure in point number 3; when they take responsibility for being the drivers of the adventure in point number 5; and when they decide to return to their familiar situation by facing the odds and winning the day in point 7. Each of these points defines a cliffhanger in the story, and if you time your sessions well, at the end of each session you will leave your players craving for more. At the end of session one, they will be excited because they are ready to solve their needs. At the end of session two, they will understand they need to lead the story. At the end of session three, they will probably fear for the

#### Timing is essential
One of my personal mistakes was that I was always trying to cram too many things in a single session. I wanted my the characters to do too much in a 3 hours session. This was causing the players often to be puzzled on what happened. I was going too fast, and they weren't able to appreciate the game. So, my personal target became to plan fewer things, to make stories a bit lighter and blander.

Try and understand your players as much as you can. When you start timing each event correctly, then you will learn how to make your plots more entertaining, without overrunning.

Also, knowing your players well, and realising what they appreciate the most, may help you changing the ratio of the adventure, maybe making the first part spanning over two sessions (this is rare) or the ending one lasting longer (easier).

### An Example of an Adventure creation

#### Adventure Main Questions

Before jumping into the eight points of the Story Circle method, you need to begin from the end. It is not counterintuitive, it simplifies the implementation of your adventure. So, to start, you need to answer three questions:
1. What are the heroes going to achieve at the end of the adventure?
2. Why do they need to go through the adventure?
3. How are they going to reach their goals?
Keep the answer to these questions short and simple. You don't need to write an essay for each of them, on the contrary, you should be able to summarise every answer in one sentence

>**Saving the Ryloth resistance**
>
>**WHAT?** The heroes need to rescue Cham Syndula after the failed revolt against the Emperor and Darth Vader
>
>**WHY?** Cham Syndula can put them in contact with Fulcrum and the newly formed Rebellion
>
>**HOW?** They need to fly a stolen Imperial vessel to Ryloth

#### Turning Points

Now that we have identified goals of the adventure, it is time to dig into Harmond's 8 points in the Story Circle. In general, each of the points marks a plot twist. This means that in terms of game and game time, these are small parts, and are generally linked to the characters' decisions. To create the adventure you need to define what's in between the points. That is where the fun is going to be. So, how are you going to create your adventure? It is simple: you define what the plot turns are and then you decide what to do in between them. It is easier done than said!

Let's define the eight points for our adventure. Please note that I will not start from point 1. Defining the milestones (points 7, 5, 3 and 1) in reverse order makes your job easier, especially if after having defined them, you immediately define the point that follows (points 8, 6, 4 and 2).

7.  RETURN - how do they return to the familiar situation? Remember that this is a plot twist, and so far they have not succeeded yet.

> 7. The PCs realise that the Imperial vessel they have stolen cannot be used to leave Ryloth. They have to realise they need a new Imperial ship to escape.

Great, let's remember that there are no "encounters" in the points, only in between points. If we consider this plot twist, we can say that the next point, number 8, is the PCs victory

8. CHANGE - How does the story changes, giving the PCs their victory?

>8. The PCs manage to escape Ryloth's atmosphere, and with Cham Syndula's help, the ship jumps to hyperspace before the Imperial Garrison on Ryloth is able to send a message on the Star Destroyers circling the planet!

Ok, we have two turning points in our adventure. The question we need to have an answer now is: why couldn't they use the same ship they stole?

5. FIND - Here the heroes find what they seek or want, or at least they think so.
Try to remember that this is the midpoint in the story, the moment in which the characters move from being part of the story, to take responsibility.

> 5. The PCs realise that by jumping to hyperspeed towards Ryloth in a stolen Imperial ship is a ticket without return. They will be in charge of their future!

6. TAKE - You have to define how do the PCs manage to take what they need while paying a heavy price. This is the preparation for their first attempt and failure.

> 6. The PCs are discovered by an Imperial Garrison, which identifies them as intruders!

Please note that, again, all these are twists in the adventure, they are not the adventure itself.  Let's continue going back in time and let's define the hook of the campaign.

3. GO - Make sure the PCs accept the call to arms and embark in your adventure!

>3. The PCs decide to go to save Cham Syndula

Which bring us immediately to the next point, the search.

4. SEARCH - the PCs adapt to their new challenge and embark in the proper adventure. In the case of our Star Wars example

>4. The PCs get to know there is a ship on Correllia which is waiting for a new crew

I would like to mention that point number 3 is a key moment of the adventure. The PCs may well decide not to accept your challenge, and go to drink instead. This is why the point number 2 is one of the most important.

2. NEED - make sure that your player characters feel a strong need to embark on your adventure. An innkeeper offering a few gold coins to check a nearby cave is a lousy need. But being robbed and humiliated by a creature that the innkeeper says lives in the cave nearby is for sure a great driver for your PCs to storm the cave. Make it personal: the more the PCs think it is their idea to embark on the journey, the easier writing your hook will be!

>2. One of the PCs realises that the encrypted message was generated by their dead parents' house on Ryloth

If it was my character, I would not think twice!

Now the last point to write if number 1, where you just introduce the norm and the plot.

1. YOU - What is the player characters norm? What do they consider "normal life" at that moment?

>1. Finally, after a few months of hard work, the PCs were finally able to rest for a few weeks on Mandalore.

#### Events

Now you have the turning points of your adventure, now it is time to pencil in what you want your player characters to go through. Please remember, you should not write a "do-or-die" path: that is a railroad. You should write your adventure with very simple ideas. Invest in defining the Non-Player Characters, Locations and Factions which will bring the adventure alive, but write every event as if it was a draft. The best thing you can do is to let the players dictate the real path of the adventure!

The way I write and adventure is simple: I decide what events the player characters go through.

##### Episode/Session 1

```
1. Finally, after a few months of hard work, the PCs were finally able to rest for a few weeks on Mandalore.

As the Game Master, I want the PCs to jump on the possibility to rescue Cham Syndula from the hands of the Empire. We need to introduce them to the fact that they have been quiet for a while, but we need to make sure that they start to feel the need to join the adventure. A good idea is to give them a good kick.

>**1.01 - The lazy Sunday Morning** (_GM Time - 15'_)
>- Introduce the fact that they have been idle for a while (_maybe you invested the previous session sandboxing their downtime, and that gave you the idea for this adventure_).
>- Give the players the time to get in "game mode"

>**1.02 - Intercepting an encrypted communication** (_Social Interaction - 30'_)
>-  One of the _nerdy_ NPCs will join the main party with a sombre face. Let's call them Sydney
>- Make sure the PCs understand there is stress
>- Sydney tell they have intercepted an encrypted communication
>- The PCs should not understand what is going on and why this is relevant
>- Sydney tells the Twi'Lek of the group that the transmission has the generation identifier of her dead parents' home on Ryloth
>- Sydney does not have the ability to decode the transmission where they are, they need a more powerful computer.

These two events may take between 30 and 45 minutes. They won't be enough to fill a session, of course, but they are a good start! We have planted the seed for the adventure, and we have made it personal. Now that at least one of the PCs is involved, it is time to play!

Oh, wait, what if the Twi'Lek player character just shrugs their shoulder and say "They never loved me enough, I don't want to get caught in their shit!". As the game master, you need to plan for the expected, but be ready to react to the unexpected. After all, it is as much your player characters' world as much as yours!

```
2. One of the PCs realises that the encrypted message was generated by their dead parents' house on Ryloth
```

What do we need between now and the end of the first session? The PCs need to be able to decrypt the message, understand the implications and decide to jump on the adventure.

>**2.01 - We need computing power** (_Planning and Recaps - 30'_)
>- The PCs need to understand they need computer power to decrypt the message
>- Use Sydney to give the PCs the information they lack
>- There is a main data exchange close to where they are
>- Breaking in the data exchange may give them access to enough computer power to decode the transmission
>- Sydney is not an adventurer and won't go with them, but can help them remotely

Please keep in mind that the story can go very differently from how I am planning. What if one of the PC wants to get in touch with an old NPC she met before and that owes her one? Maybe that NPC was a slicer who has access to enough computing power. Is he going to help? The key thing to remember while writing an adventure is that you need to plan for something which may never happen. Be flexible and don't railroad your player characters in what you want.

>**2.02 - The Data Exchange** (_Action - 30'_)
>- The data exchange is a large building, but without lots of security
>- The PCs can infiltrate the defences easily (if they decide to break in) or convince the guard
>- Make it exciting, the possibility of getting caught is real

>**2.03 - Imperials in the exchange!** (_Encounter - 60'_)
>- The PCs start decrypting the transmission
>- The decryption will take a significant amount of time, maybe 3 hours
>- After the PCs start decrypting the transmission, they will realise there is a group of Imperials in the Data Exchange building
>- The PCs can decide to try and avoid the Imperials or just fight them off

>**2.04 - Cham Syndula's Plea** (_GM Time - 15'_)
>- Describe Cham Syndula's message
>- The video is addressed to a certain "Fulcrum"
>- They attacked the Emperor's Star Destroyer, but failed to kill the emperor
>- The resistance on Ryloth is heavily damaged and exposed
>- While he does not want to leave, that's the only way to keep the resistance against the Empire alive
>- Ryloth is under blockade and only Imperial spaceships are allowed Through
>- Make sure Sydney can tell them that the transmission has not been received by anyone else

>**2.05 - Should we go?** (_Planning - 15'_)
>- The PCs can be on their way back to where they live, or just finish the discussion in the Data Exchange
>- Allow the PCs to talk and decide what to do
>- Use an NPC if needed to ask the right questions

The key element at this point is to build tension and expectation in the player characters, and the moment they say "Yes, we go to this mission", when they feel empowered, it is time to stop the session. Well done, you just created the first act for an incredibly exciting adventure!

```
3. The PCs decide to go to save Cham Syndula
```

##### Episode/Session 2

Your players are now excited because their characters will embark on an adventure to save a rebellious leader. Now, by moving in the lower semicircle of the Story Circle, they enter in the special moment, in the chaotic part of the adventure. You need to create a meaty journey and let the player live it at its best. Let's create more events to connect the dots!

How do we get the PCs from being where they are to knowing there is a ship on Correllia they can steal? What about creating an informer who can give them the information? This part should take roughly half a session, a bit more than an hour, so why don't we plot these things:

>**3.01 - Tell us more** _Social Interaction - 15'_)
>- The PCs will interact with some NPCs to make sure they have the right information
>- One of the NPCs (_maybe Sydney_) tells them that there is a hacker in one of the lower districts of the city which is known to be very well informed on Empire ships.
>- Keep it short and simple

>**3.02 - An abandoned warehouse** (_Exploration - 30'_)
>- The PCs will reach an abandoned warehouse, where the hacker should be
>- The hacker does not want to be found, so his lair is quite hidden in the warehouse
>- The PCs should explore the warehouse and manage to find indications that there is a hidden room
>- Balance the frightening place with the PCs paranoia if you need to play it a bit longer

>**3.03 - The slicer who knows a lot of codes** (_Social Interaction - 30'_)
>- Gilgamesh, the hacker, knew the PCs were coming, he had security cameras
>- The NPC is frightened and will hold a blaster against the PCs, clearly shaking and with the security still locked (_what about a perception check?_)
>- Gilgamesh knows about a ship the PCs can use and knows how to get it
>- The PCs can offer something in return for the information or just scare the hell out of Gilgamesh. That may influence future adventures
>- If the PCs don't screw things badly, they should get the information out of Gilgamesh
>- There is a new ship ready to be deployed on Correllia. The ship is expecting a crew to be dispatched in a few day's time. Gilgamesh has the necessary codes to fake they are the crew.

One thing to keep in mind when you introduce an NPC is to make it well. Don't just describe them, give them a soul! Why do they do what they do? What is their ideal happy life? What do they plan to do to reach their goals?
Simple questions which will make your NPCs stand out.

```
4. The PCs get to know there is a ship on Correllia which is waiting for a new crew
```

>**4.01 - Landing on Correllia** (_Social Interactions - 30'_)
>- The PCs need to fly to Correlia
>- Foster roleplaying time, possibly with a NPCs to keep an adrenalin spin to what they need to do
>- Interaction with Imperial ground control to land their ship

This phase of the adventure should be about doing things.  Make sure you plan things, but allow space for the PCs to interact with the world

>**4.02 - We Need Imperial's costumes** (_Action - 45'_)
>- The PCs need to obtain Imperial dresses/armours
>- Allow the PCs to think on how to get it
>- Available idea: kidnap Imperials and steal their clothes
>- Find an Imperial Garrison and persuade/coerce the person to give them clothes
>- Go on the black market
>- The PCs should feel in charge of their decision, you should help them directing towards one option or another depending on the time they have already used and/or the option you are most comfortable with and/or the option that better suit your player characters' style

As you notice, on some occasions it is absolutely fine to open your adventure to a more sandboxed environment. Just remember that the timing is essential to end a session at a specific point so that your players enjoy it more!

>**4.03 - The flight of the Tydirium 375** (_Action - 15'_)
>- The PCs, with their Imperial clothes, can now take the ship and fly away
>- Make it tense, with the Imperial technician telling them they were not expected today, but that in the end their code matches
>- A bit of paranoia is always good in these occasions
>- If the PCs failed to get Imperial clothes, make them have a good reason why they are not properly dressed

>**4.04 - That's it!** (_GM Time - 5'_)
>- When the Tydirium 375 makes the jump to hyperspace, make the PCs realise that is a jump without a safety net.
>- Tell them they have embraced the revolt on Ryloth
>- Make them feel empowered by their choice
>- End the session

I like to end the sessions on a few seconds of personal reflection. This allows me to clarify certain information the PCs may have missed or forgotten and set the bar high for the cliffhanger.

```
5. The PCs realise that by jumping to hyperspeed towards Ryloth in a stolen Imperial ship is a ticket without return. They will be in charge of their future!
```

##### Episode/Session 3

>**5.01 - Passing through the blockade** (_Social Interaction - 15'_)
>- The Tydirium 375 comes out from hyperspace in the middle of **a lot** of Imperial ships, from star destroyers to tie fighters.
>- Make the scene frightening
>- The only interaction is flight control asking for their ship code and the reason they are there
>- Try not to vaporize the PCs, but make them come out with a good excuse. The Imperial forces are still trying to organise themselves, so it is still easy to pass through
>- For a more scenic moment, make a normal ship appearing out of hyperspace, refusing to give their code and being destroyed by a flock of tie fighters.
>- The PCs can land in a designated spot
>- **IMPORTANT** make sure that the PCs create a link with the ship so that they can be ready to fly away quickly. This will come back later.

The big question here is: is the party going to _split_? In such eventuality, if some of them want to stand on the ship, you can give them an insight on the fact that the Imperials have some doubts on them, and that a recon team may approach!

>**5.02 - Contacting Cham Syndula** (_Action - 15'_)
>- The PCs won't be bothered by the Imperial Garrison on the ground
>- It must be clear that life on Ryloth is a bit nervous right now
>- The PCs have a number they can use to get in touch with Cham Syndula
>- The PCs will be directed to one of the large brothels in the capital, where all the Imperials go, but where nobody looks at you in the face

>**5.03 - The Brothel** (_Social Interaction - 30'_)
>- One of Syndula's second in command will approach the party
>- Make her scepticism visible
>- The PCs need to convince her
>- If the Twi'Lek of the group will inquire about the location of the transmissions (their parents' house), the second in command will tell that Cham can answer that question
>- Take the interaction on the brink of becoming violent so much distrust there is from the Rylothian side
>- The only way to convince the Twi'Leks is by letting the Twi'Lek of the group speak and persuade them

This event is quite intense, and for many player characters, 45 minutes may not be enough. Try to balance what you want to achieve with how much time you can spend here

>**5.03 - There she is!** (_Combat - 30'_)
>- The first imperial to see the party will recognise Cham Syndula's second in command, ordering the party to stop.
>- The Twil'Leks will react by shooting first and going into the city small streets
>- Describe the city well (_Make sure you know how the cities in Ryloth are built_)
>- Keep the combat short, it is more important for the PCs to follow the Twi'Leks than to kill the Imperials

```
6. The PCs are discovered by an Imperial Garrison, which identifies them as intruders!
```

>**6.01 - There is a Rebellion starting** (_Social Interaction - 45'_)
>- PCs to meet Cham Syndula
>- Syndula is the only one who can leave Ryloth because if others disappear, the entire cover for all of them is burned.
>- Spend enough time to create the right mood: after all Cham is an important person, give him enough character
>- Invest some time to make sure that the Twi'Leks show their doubts on the PCs
>- Cham Syndula knew one of the PCs parents, which supported him. This is why the message was sent from their home
>- This event should be purposefully slow and quiet, the calm before the storm

>**6.02 - They know you are here!** (_Social Interaction - 15'_)
>- The PCs need to receive a message from the ship (or from the other part of the party) that the Imperials are impounding their ship
>- The NPCs will have to convey the same message
>- Start an interaction with the NPCs that is designed to create despair "_We will be stuck here forever now..._" kind of idea
>- If the PCs don't come with the same idea before, let Cham Syndula bring back hope, telling the PCs they can steal another ship!

Please keep in mind that if previously the party decided to split, you have to adapt this part of the session and move from one group to the other. The goal is the same: to make sure that the PCs understand they cannot use the same ship to go away from Ryloth.

```
7. The PCs realise that the Imperial vessel they have stolen cannot be used to leave Ryloth. They have to realise they need a new Imperial ship to escape.
```

##### Episode/Session 4

>**7.01 - The Garrison on the plain** (_Social Interaction - 15'_)
>- This is the beginning of the resurrection. The PCs failed, but it is payback time for them. **Make it Epic**
>- The NPCs mention that there is a small spaceport which is used only for freights
>- The NPCs tell that it is guarded, but they know a way in
>- One of the NPCs says that as long as they are quick and stealthy, they can jump to hyperspeed before the rest of the garrison realises there is a problem
>- Make the PCs feel that this is something dangerous, but doable
>- No NPCs can go in the mission, only the PCs can save Cham Syndula

You should allow the PCs other choices if they like, but be ready to change the way you end the adventure. This is a moment in which if the player characters don't accept this route, they have to come away with another way of doing things. Keep in mind that no NPCs can get in this part of the adventure, apart from Cham Syndula.

>**7.02 - The Garrison Control Centre** (_Action - 20'_)
>- The PCs can access the garrison form a ventilation shaft that reaches the control centre.
>- Make it difficult to get to the control centre
>- There are 2 Imperials in the control centre. They have to be killed stealthily to avoid them to sound the alarm
>- In the control centre the PCs can steal the codes for a small ship to depart

This is an action event, not a combat one. Keep the killing of the Imperials as a done deal if they are stealthy, or a quick killing if they are not. Apart from stressing that they have to be silent (_use Cham Syndula if you need_) focus more on getting there through the ventilation shaft.

>**7.03 - Stormtroopers!** (_Combat - 20'_)
>- Between the control centre and the ship there are a few corridors
>- The PCs will meet 5 Imperial troopers. They can eliminate them without being stealthy


>**7.04 - Sneaking to the ship** (_Action - 20'_)
>- The last part to get to the ship is in the open
>- The PCs have the code, but they should feel safer NOT to be seen while getting to the ship
>- Syndula is recognisable, like every other non-human

It is important that you play all the cards in your deck to make sure the PCs feels the importance of these past events. Make them nervous!

>**7.05 - Jump to hyperspace** (_Action - 15'_)
>- The PCs are **triumphant**, this is their moment of glory! Don't downplay their magnificent efforts
>- Once the PCs will take off, Cham Syndula will give them safe coordinates for the hyperspace jump
>- Make the PCs tremble a little when the star destroyer will ask them the codes for the jump, but remember, this is their moment of triumph!

```
8. The PCs manage to escape Ryloth's atmosphere, and with Cham Syndula's help, the ship jumps to hyperspace before the Imperial Garrison on Ryloth is able to send a message on the Star Destroyers circling the planet!
```

>**8.01 - This is only a goodbye!** (_Social Interaction - 5'_)
>- The PCs will come out of hyperspace in the middle of nowhere.
>- There is another ship ready to take him on board
>- Cham Syndula will tell the PCs that they can't see who is on the other ship
>- He will reward the PCs by giving them a card with a decryption program

```

"Welcome to the Rebellion!"

```

>**8.02 - Victory** (_Planning and Recaps - 45'_)
>Give time to your PCs to rejoice, after all, they lived an incredible adventure, and they need time to steam off.
>They can wander around, or just get ready for your next amazing adventure, but they deserve to do what they want! Do not underestimate this part!

One thing you have to remember is that how many encounters you put between one point in the Story Circle and the other depends entirely by how much you know your players. Do they tend to think a lot before acting? Use fewer planning events and let them role play a lot. Are they swift to take out their weapons and shoot whatever moves? Give them more encounters. Do they like to explore the world they live in details? Fewer explorations.
You need to know your players and you have to know yourself. Make sure you use your first adventure to learn these details and to adapt your storytelling style to give a good pace.
