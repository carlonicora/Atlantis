# Example: The Master Plot

> **Martin Hume-Chester** wants to invoke the **Beast of Sho'naii** to eliminate his rivals to the run the head of the **Conservative Party**

This is your master plot. If you feel it is a let down, don't worry, you will have time to expand it... a lot. For now, you should already consider that you have a generic idea of what your campaign is going to be. You know it has a political background, you also know it works with occultism and you have your main antagonist. This is more than enough to **start**!
