# Storytelling

The idea of being a "good storyteller" boils down to be able to create world and stories your players are going to love. If your players can't stop talking about what happened in the last session and they come back for more, you know you are doing a great job.

Yet, the road to having fun, for a storyteller, is not as simple as the one our players have. There are a lot of things that go behind the scenes of a good role-playing game adventure, and many of them fall on the storyteller's shoulder. While role-playing is a group effort, and the final story is written by the players, it is your responsibility to lay the foundations for your players to build on.

In this part of the book, we will do deeper in the things we do to create unforgettable stories. We will I've you access to all our secrets.

## The golden rule of a good game master

A good game master is the one that is able to make their player characters interact with and shape a story which everyone love.

This means that your role of unsung hero will require you to change your plots, stories, ideas and expectations. Become comfortable with changes, because that's the only way you can be a good game master.

## Sandboxing or Railroading?

Online it is easy to find a holy war raging between supporters of sandboxing games and "railroaders". Jinx is neither but sits in the middle. A campaign well plotted and a flexible approach to adventures, which keeps into consideration the players as the most essential elements of a role-playing game, is what Jinx supports. In realising that both sides have pro and con, we take an approach which enhances storytelling and fun. Please do remember that in role-playing games there are no winning conditions, there is fun.

If you are new to the terms "sandboxing" and "railroading", then you have an advantage, as you won't have to forget what you have learned. However, should you be a strong supporter of one or the other, the advice we can give you is to open your mind and read this book. If, then, you'll feel that your way is the right way, by any means, please do play as you love. What we know is that every game master, dungeon master or storyteller has their own fabulous way of running a game. The important thing is to do it.

## Failing to plan means planning to fail

It does not matter if you are a strong believer in a sandbox in approach, or if you agree with a more structured approach as this game preaches. The reality is that if you, as the storyteller, fail to plan means you will let our players down. Your role is critical to the success of the game. If you work out your story or world well, your players will help you shape the adventures their character will live. If you don't, improvisation alone won't be enough to entertain your players.

## The building blocks of a story

In the next subchapters, we will often refer to a lot of terms which every seasoned storyteller knows. Feel free to keep these terms in mind as an introduction to what we are ping to dig deeper later.

**Storyteller** or **Game Master**: a player who is responsible to manage the game and set the story the player characters are going to live.

**Player**: a real person who plays a role-playing game.

**Character** or **Player Character** or **PC**: a fictional figure which the player controls during the game. This is not a real person.

**Campaign**: a large and complex story arc that spans across many adventures, and that lasts months, if not years, of play.

**Adventures**: a story split amongst a finite number of sessions which tells a self-contained story, which can be an integral part of a campaign.

**Session**: a few continuative hours of play, where the player characters are exposed to a series of Scenes.

**Scene**: something that happens during a role-playing game session and that is designed to involve a player character in the story.

** Non-Player Character** or **NPC**: a fictional figure controlled by the storyteller. Every single living being in a story which is not a player characters. These characters are controlled by the storyteller.

**Location**: A place where your player characters can live their adventures. It can be as small as a room, or as large as an empire.

**Faction**: Many times Non-Player Characters group together and form groups. They can be a guild, as well as a crime syndicate.

## The Assumption of Heroism

Combat is not a pivotal point in Jinx. It is different from all the other abilities for the way it is dealt with, but it should not be the most important part of the adventures. This is why the combat should be regulated by the **Assumption of Heroism**. This is the idea that, by default, the player characters win. This does not mean that the combat should not be dangerous to the player characters, on the contrary, the risk of death should loom over every combat, it simply means that the non-player characters must prove themselves extraordinary to win.

The Assumption of Heroism means that the storyteller should allow any non-player character to be able to perform only a limited number of combat round before being defeated, either by being killed by the player characters or by fleeing the scene.

This rule applies exclusively if the player characters manage to hit their foe. A player character who does not try to actively engage in combat or that does not hit the opponent, does not fall in the *heroism* category.

As the storyteller, you have to understand how long combat should last, and how the foes will challenge the player characters. Planning, even in this case, is paramount to create a positive experience for your players. What will the non-player characters do in every round they have available? How will they play their cards? You should try and prepare these details before each combat, but adapt them during it to shape the game around your player characters' actions.

## Setting thresholds

Jinx bases many ability checks on a threshold scale that you, the storyteller, need to identify. While using a custom selection of the threshold is a challenge for new storytellers, it is a weapon you can use to influence a game for the enjoyment of everyone. Setting a threshold value is more art than science. With experience, it becomes easier to set the values.

But let's go back to the advantages of having a variable challenge. Let's say your players have managed to fight their ways through countless challenges, and they are now trying to sneakily pass through a gate without being spotted. You build up the tension, you describe the world around them and then ask a *stealth* check. The player character rolls a success of 72, while you had set a threshold of 75. What would happen if they fail? Maybe the story will be best for everyone if the player character had succeeded. So you narrate the player character's action, build up the tension, and finish the description with a judgment call if to make the action succeed or not.

As the storyteller, it is your call if to openly announce the threshold before the roll, or if to keep it secret. The first is a build up on the dice, the second on you. What we mean is that by announcing the threshold, the players will focus on the dice to understand if their action succeeds. On the contrary, if you are keeping the threshold secret, they will tell you their degree of success, but you can them play the action resolution epically.

> *Player*: Groncon runs on the collapsing bridge, and jumps towards the tower, trying to grapple himself on one of the window ledges
>
> *Storyteller*: You run as fast as you can, wailing your arms trying not to lose balance, and when you feel the bridge finally giving in, you jump as far as you can. Please give me a check on Athletics
>
> *Player*: I have an Athletics ability of 47 and I rolled a 17, for a total of 64...
>
> *Storyteller look at the players for a moment*: Groncon jumps from the collapsing bridge. Behind him, the three orcs realise too late the fate that awaits them. With panic in their eyes, they try desperately to stop and run back, but it is too late and they fall in the chasm below. In the meantime, Groncon, extending his arms, tries desperately to reach one of the window ledges. *Storyteller pauses for a moment, looking at his players* He stops just a few inches short from the wall... luckily for him, the ledges are just those few inches deep to allow him to barely hold himself to them. Groncon *the storyteller turns to him* you hold yourself with your nails, and you hit the wall rather violently. Yet, after a few seconds of fear, you realise you managed to escape the three orcs.
