# Jinx: Simple Storytelling Role Playing Game Mechanics

## Game Mechanics
The mechanic of the game is extremely simple. In the majority of the actions, the storyteller should define if the action itself deserves a challenge, or if it is an immediate success or failure. The storyteller should always give priority to the story, avoiding countless dice rolling. However, in case where the action should prove itself, the player should overcome a threshold with an action check. The value of the action check is the three values: **ability** needed by the action, **traits** upon which the ability belongs to and a good old **d20**.

The storyteller should award a variable number depending on how well the player has described their character's action. The better and more engaging the description, the higher the reward.

```
action check = trait + ability + d20 + bonus
```

## Type of Actions
The game mechanics keep two type of actions into consideration: unchallenged and challenged. The unchallenged actions are those actions against an unanimated objects. The challenged actions, on the contrary, are those against other characters. For example, jumping over a fence is an unchallenged action, while trying to punch another character is a challenged one.

To succeed in an unchallenged action, the player should score an action check higher than a threshold defined by the storyteller.

In case of a challenged action, the two characters should both roll for an action check. The character with a higher action check wins the challenge. 

> Martin is trying to punch Anne. Martin has a *punching* ability of 18, a *strength* traits of 12, a *dice roll* of 8 and receives a *storytelling bonus* of 7 from the storyteller, for a total of 45. Anne, who is very agile, uses her *dodging* ability of 16, the *agility* trait of 18 and a *dice roll* of 10 and receives *storytelling bonus* of 10 for a total of 54. Clearly Martin tries to punch Anne in the face, but she simply dodges his attempt.

## Traits
Every character is defined by a set of traits. These traits have values between 1 and 20. The traits are:

* strength
* intelligence
* charisma
* agility

## Abilities
These are a set of things a character knows how to perform. Each player can define which ones their character has. Every ability should depend from one of the traits. Special elements as spells are counted as abilities, with each spell being a standalone ability.

Each ability has a value that spans between 0 and 100.

## Dice
Take a nice d20 and roll it! That's as simple as it gets.

If you roll a 19, you can add an additional roll to your ability check value. If you roll a 20 you can add two additional rolls to it. However, if you roll a 1, you will have to remove the result of an additional roll to your ability check value. The additional rolls are not affected by the same rule.

## Storytelling bonus
The idea is that great stories do not need a lot of dice rolling. It keeps the story moving and the players entertained. The storytellers should try to focus more on a great narrative, trying to involve the players as much as possible into it. Dice rolling and math should be left where Lady Luck should be involved, or if you want to hurt a character.

The storytelling bonus should be applied by the storyteller after the player has described their character's action, but before rolling the dice.

## Damages, protections and death
Damages are inflicted to the characters when they lose a challenged action, or when they clumsily fall from the third floor. In reality, being shot in the back does not count as a challenged action, yet if you are on the receiving end, it will hurt. The amount of damages received is calculated by adding the damage factor of the weapon used in percentage to the level of success and the eventual protection the character receiving the damage possesses.

```
damage = weapon * success / 100 - protection
```

> Anne, just having dodged Martin's punch, decides to stomp her elbow on Martin's nose. Anne scores a 55 on her ability check, against 25 of Martin's. While the elbow provides only 10 damage points, the nose is completely unprotected, therefore Anne produces 3 damages to Martin (10 * 30 /100 - 0).

Every character has a number of live points equal to 50 + their strength. If you think that's not much, try receiving an elbow in your nose, and then we discuss.

## Unchallenged actions complexity
An action check can be valued between 0 and 160, with extremely lucky cases of 200. The storyteller should keep a scale in mind while setting the threshold for unchallenged actions, where 0 is breathing, 200 is curing cancer and so on.

## Character creation
The character creation should be as flexible as the Storyteller wants. The idea is to focus much more on the character identification than the numbers on a piece of paper. What is the character main goal in life or what are the psychological traits they have are more important than how strong they are.
For the traits, you can ask the player to roll 4d20 to identify them, or assign 40 to 50 points to be distributed amongst them. Keep it flexible and fun: you want the characters to have strengths and weaknesses.

Then start discussing with the player about the abilities. You can create a list of abilities to pick from or improvise. *Fly casual* and remember to prioritise the characters' details more than their nitty gritty numbers.

## Character progression
As in life, characters grow their abilities when they practice. Yes, practice makes perfect! So, every time a character performs an action, the storyteller should keep track of it. Not only successful actions should be kept into consideration: we learn from our mistakes as well!

Every time there is a moment of calm in a campaign, the Storyteller should allow a character to improve the value of the abilities they practiced. Each character can improve a maximum of five abilities at a time. To improve an ability, the character should roll 1d20 and score equal or higher than his ability score divided by 5 (in case of a successful action) or by 4 (in case of a failed action). If the roll succeed, the ability will be raised by 1 point.

The character progression should be done quite often, to give the characters the possibility to grow steadily.
