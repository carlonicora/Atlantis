# Character creation

Characters are not just a few stats that may determine the outcome of an action. Characters are complex beings which have a history behind them, a psychological nature and only then some numbers. As a player, you should bring to life a three dimensional character, no matter if you are attracted by brute force characters or thinkers.

To me, the character creation is not a solo-effort. It should be a group effort in which the storyteller and the player come together. This way, the storyteller can have a great insight into the player characters, which will make their life easier while plotting adventures.

To create a character, you should follow these steps:

1. Define your character's demographic information
2. Pick your character psychological traits
3. Put some numbers behind Traits and Abilities
4. Write your character's backstory

These four steps will be enough to have a great character with whom to have fun!

## Demographic

The character's demographics are all those information relative to the physical and historical part

## Psychographic

## Traits and Abilities

### Traits

Every character is identified by three main traits.

- **Body** identifies everything related to strength, agility, health.
- **Mind** defines intellectual capabilities.
- **Spirit** is used for the characters self-esteem, confidence and presence.

Every player has 30 points to divide in the three traits of their character. The limit helps create a character that can have strength and weaknesses alike.

### Abilities

Every character possesses a list of abilities. These are the things a character know how to do. The abilities define the character, as Jinx does not have the notion of class.

Each ability is linked to one of the three main traits. The trait defines the initial value for each ability.

At the beginning of the game, each character possesses five abilities of their choice. The player has 60 points to distribute in the five abilities, with a limit of 20 points in each ability.

The list of available abilities is found below.

### Life Points
Every player character has 40 life points plus the value of their **Body**. When lost, life points can be recovered by sleeping or meditating (1 every 6 hours) or through medical treatment.

`life points = 40 + Body`

## Backstory

In Jinx, a character backstory is as important as any other trait or ability, if not more. The guidelines of a player character's backstory should always be agreed with the storyteller. However, it is important for the player to describe their character's backstory. This is a moment in which each player learns about their character and bond with it.

To write a character backstory that is central to your character record sheet, you should follow these steps:

1. Write something about your character demographic
2. Write about your character psychographic information
3. Describe how your character acquired their abilities

### Start with your demographic

When writing your backstory, you should keep well in mind your character's race, gender and general demographic information. This should be the base of the story you are going to tell about your character.

### Bring in your psychographic information

Jinx leverages the OCEAN personality definition. It is a very simple way to characterise a person, or a player character in this case, with five simple values. These values, as described in the [psychography](#psychography) part above, identify one characteristic of your character's personality. You should write a small episode linked to each of the detailed traits.

@TODO EXAMPLE

### How were their abilities learned

Every character starts the game with at least 3 ability. Writing how these skills were learned is a fantastic way to give a context to your character. Tell a story about how your character developed.
