Jinx is a simple mechanic for Role Playing Games. It is designed to be flexible and lightweight, and should ideally be used only in case of need. They are flexible enough to be used in any setting, from Fantasy to Science Fiction. In this document you won't find a monster compendium, a comprehensive list of attributes. Some of those may be expanded in the future.
