# Introduction

When I started writing Jinx, I did not think I would have written an entire book. I was looking for some simple mechanics which would allow me to focus more on storytelling than others. I liked the vast availability of D&D, but there were some pet peeves which kept me away from it, namely levels and classes. Alas, I had always been one of those storytellers who preferred characters without labels attached to them. I was more in line with mechanics a-la Call of Cthulhu, but Fantasy has always been a love of mine.

Truth is that I wrote some simple mechanics and I started playing with them. My players were thrown in an intense campaign and, without realising, they became my playtesters. The first good thing is that, by focusing more on the story and less on the rolls, I was able to gently lead them to each rule. The second good thing was that the mechanics worked precisely as expected, and they were smooth and simple to learn while keeping the flexibility I was looking for.

The book you have in your hand is one of the many iterations in making the rules better and the information more readable. I never thought someone would have read what started as a one-pager mechanics. Nonetheless, I hope you will like it, or that at least it will give you some exciting ideas to work on!

## The goals of Jinx

In the world of Tabletop Role-Playing Games, Jinx is but a drop in the ocean. Yet, it has been written with clear goals in mind:

- provide a minimalistic mechanics that supports storytelling
- define a system to help storytellers to create campaigns and adventures

Jinx focuses more on giving player characters the possibility to grow as complex entities. This means supporting a multi-faceted growth without the need for identifying classes or archetypes. It also supports a balanced approach to combat, by making it dangerous.

In the end, what you have to remember is that it will be up to the storyteller to use these rules at the best of their possibility. I have seen fantastic campaigns played by incredible game masters on rubbish rules, but I have very rarely seen bad game masters deliver quality adventures with whichever mechanics.

The final goal of Jinx is to help shape great storytellers, allowing them to focus more on stories and less on rules!

## An example of play

> **Storyteller**: When you reach the base of the tower, you notice two men sitting with their backs on the door.
>
> **Faby**: Are they asleep?
>
> **Storyteller**: No, they are talking amongst each other
>
> **Will**: Can we get close to them without being noticed
>
> **Storyteller**: Not really, especially because they have already spotted you. They are standing up, and you notice that one of the two is adjusting his sword
>
> **Faby**: How far are we from them?
>
> **Storyteller**: They are roughly 20 meters from them. Now that that stood up, you can see they are quite tall. One of them has a sleeveless shirt, and his arms are full of tattoos
>
> **Will**: Do I recognise any of the tattoos?
>
> **Storyteller**: Without any doubt. You have seen them many times during the last war.
>
> **Will**: Shit...
>
> **Faby**: I take my bow out, and I take aim
>
> **Storyteller**: When they see you taking your bow out they start moving towards you. One of them seems smarter than the other and moves quite erratically, the other focuses on speed
>
> **Will**: I guess Brikoto takes out his long sword
>
> **Faby**: I spend one turn to carefully aim to the idiot running straight towards me
>
> **Storyteller**: He seems to be sure he can reach you before you can let your arrow fly. He is raising his sword while he runs. It is obvious that the other is smarter, as while he is moving towards you, he starts shouting.
>
> **Will**: Brikoto moves towards the second man saying "*So much for trying and be quiet...*"
>
> **Faby**: Okado let the arrow fly, and says to Brikoto "*Hey, I told you we should have gone from the other entrance!*"
>
> **Storyteller**: Roll to hit, Faby
>
> **Faby rolls a die**: Okado's ability with the bow is 49, plus 17 of the dice, plus 10 as I was aiming for one turn... I have 74, minus 25 to hit, I have a success of 51. 15 damages times 3, Okado strikes 45 damages with a single arrow!
>
> **Storyteller**: You see the first man running straight towards Okado, that let one of her arrows fly towards him. His velocity is immediately halted when the arrow hits him straight on his head, making him fall heavily on his back. Will, what do you do?
>
> **Will**: running erratically or not, as soon as the second idiot is close, I swing my sword.
>
> **Faby**: I take out my knife, and I make sure that the first guy is not going to stand up again.
>
> **Storyteller**: The second man
