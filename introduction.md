# Introduction

When I started writing Atlantis, I did not think I would have written an entire book. I was looking for some simple mechanics which would allow me to focus more on storytelling than others. I liked the vast availability of D&D, but there were some pet peeves which kept me away from it, namely levels and classes. Alas, I had always been one of those storytellers who preferred characters without labels attached to them. I was more in line with mechanics a-la Call of Cthulhu, but Fantasy has always been a love of mine.

Truth is that I wrote some simple mechanics and I started playing with them. My players were thrown in an intense campaign and, without realising, they became my playtesters. The first good thing is that, by focusing more on the story and less on the rolls, I was able to gently lead them to each rule. The second good thing was that the mechanics worked precisely as expected, and they were smooth and simple to learn while keeping the flexibility I was looking for.

The book you have in your hand is one of the many iterations in making the rules better and the information more readable. I never thought someone would have read what started as a one-pager mechanics. Nonetheless, I hope you will like it, or that at least it will give you some exciting ideas to work on!

## The goals of Atlantis

In the world of Tabletop Role-Playing Games, Atlantis is but a drop in the ocean. Yet, it has been written with clear goals in mind:

- provide a minimalistic mechanics that supports storytelling
- define a system to help storytellers to create campaigns and adventures

Atlantis focuses more on giving player characters the possibility to grow as complex entities. This means supporting a multi-faceted growth without the need for identifying classes or archetypes. It also supports a balanced approach to combat, by making it dangerous.

In the end, what you have to remember is that it will be up to the storyteller to use these rules at the best of their possibility. I have seen fantastic campaigns played by incredible game masters on rubbish rules, but I have very rarely seen bad game masters deliver quality adventures with whichever mechanics.

The final goal of Atlantis is to help shape great storytellers, allowing them to focus more on stories and less on rules!
