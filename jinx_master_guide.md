# Jinx Master Guide

---

## Introduction

Welcome to Jinx, a role playing game which will help you dream and realise beautiful stories for and with your players. This RPG is based on two defining factors: rules simplicity and good storytelling.
Rules simplicity means that you, as game master, should be able to focus more on creating and narrating a story, more than checking books. Differently from other games, Jinx tend to embrace a certain degree of realism in the way actions and combat are carried out.
The idea of good storytelling is achieved not by connecting the rules system to the storytelling in itself. It does it by simplifying the way you can create campaigns and adventures, helping you tailoring them around your players.

Jinx has been written with a long experience in running role playing game campaigns. This means we have done a lot of mistakes, and in the process we have learned a thing or two. This book does not require you to know anything about role playing games. What we stand for is practice. Even if you have never run your own campaign, just do it. This is how we moved from throwing Kobolds to our player characters to making them oversee worlds under their dominion.

## How to be a good storyteller

You may have noticed that this guide is called the "Master Guide". This has two meanings. The first is that this book is the main book for Jinx. The second if that this book is specifically written with the game master in mind. We think that it is the master's responsibility to know the game's mechanics. They are the element of uncertainty that can build tension. As long as you know the rules well enough, your players will enjoy.

The idea of being a "good storyteller" boils down to be able to create world and stories your players are going to love. If your players can't stop talking about what happened in the last episode and they come back for more, you know you are doing a great job.

### Sandboxing or Railroading?

Online it is easy to find a holy war raging between supporters of sandboxing game and "railroaders". Jinx is neither, but sits in the middle. A campaign well plotted and a flexible approach to adventures, which keeps into consideration the players as the most important elements of a role playing game, is what Jinx supports. In realising that both sides have pro and con, Jinx takes an approach which enhances storytelling and fun. Please do remember that in a role playing games there are no winning conditions, there is fun.

If you are new to the terms "sandboxing" and "railroading", then you have an advantage, as you won't have to forget what you have learned. However, should you be a strong supporter of one or the other, the advice we can give you is to open your mind and read this book. If, then, you'll feel that your way is the right way, by any means please do play as you love. What we know is that every game master, dungeon master or storyteller has their own great way of running a game. The important thing is to do it.

### The differences between a storyteller and a player

Apart from the obvious (player proposes, storyteller approves) there are huge differences between being a storyteller and being a player. As a player you are the hero, you will fight and you will -hopefully- win. Your character will wander the world and will leave a visible mark in its history. If you are a storyteller, though, your role is the one of the unsung hero, of the stableboy and of the villain. And the challenge is that you will have to plan it all. You can certainly improvise once or twice, but if your world is not well thought through, or if your characters do not convey a story continuity, you will fail your players.

Game masters will spend hours on hours designing a city, a dungeon, a player character or a story. We will write a lot of ideas which we end up trashing because the player won't take our adventure hook. We will create the perfect NPC, trying their voice in front of the mirror, just to have them killed by a PC with low self control. However, you can look at the same thing realising that you are the narrator which creates a world your player want to return to. You are all the Gods the player characters invoke in their prayers and the beautiful elves they will fall for.

Another difference is that while players expects to be entertained, you will have to provide the entertainment, selflessly. When your player characters wins, you win. When your players have fun, you will.

### The golden rule of a good game master

A good game master is the one that is able to make their player characters interact with and shape a story which everyone love.

This means that your role of unsung hero will require you to change your plots, stories, ideas and expectations. Become comfortable with changes, because that's the only way you can be a good game master.

## Plotting a campaign

The main idea behind a great campaign is simple: you should be able to create a compelling, detailed background plot. Now, what many game masters don't understand about a campaign is that its plot is neither about the player characters nor it is the story the player characters will go through. While this may sound strange, especially after I mentioned that everything should be around your player and their characters, you need to realise one thing. Your player characters only exists in a world, and the way you allow them to exist is to have a world which can live without them. The campaign is your world without the player characters. It is the background upon which they will become heroes of villains. If you have this plot, you can allow them to interact with an interesting world.

Moreover, when you consider this plot, we find it is always best to write it from a villain perspective. While you can write a plot from the perspective of an ally, this does not give your player characters enough interesting spots to interact with the plot.

Put your thinking cap on, forget any player and start planning what your world will go through in the next months.

### The master plot
A plot is a simple sentence that identifies, without describing, a main villain and its goal.

`Lord Enoch wants to gain the throne of the Empire of Wardwore by either buying the support of the high council or killing those who oppose him`

Don't expect your master plot to tell you more than what's necessary. Your first plot does not have to be interesting. A master plot is just the baseline of what the world will go through.

### Be prepared to know everything, and everyone in your plot

Now that your master plot is ready, it is time to put it in context. This means starting reading your master plot stopping and clarify, every time you can, the following:
- what
- who
- where
- when
- how

This means that you should start noting down every detail you have in your mind and every detail you haven't yet considered. Start reading your master plot, and every time you find a word, ask yourself if you can expand on it by answering the five questions above.

`Lord Enoch` (Ok, who is he? Where does he live? What does he stands for? How has he gained power?) `wants to gain the throne of the Empire of Wardwore` (wait, what is the Empire of Wardwore? How is it ruled? Who is the current Emperor? Where is it in the world? Who are the main figures in it?) `by either buying` (How do the money he has come from? How much money does he have? Where does he keep them? When did he gain them?) `the support of the high council` (What is the High Council? How does it work? Who is in charge of it? Who is in it? How does the Emperor treat the High Council? When was it formed?) `or killing those who oppose him` (Who want to oppose him? Why do they want to oppose him? How many there are? How is he going to kill them?)

The questions we asked in this example are only a minimal part of those we should ask. You need to ask as many questions as possible, and you also have to start asking the same questions when you get your first answers. Let's say that one of the members of the High Council who is going to oppose Lord Enoch is Lady Elgolath. You need to start asking the same questions about her.

By starting from a single master plot and by exploring all the details will start creating your world in minute details. This is what you want, because by spending a few hours (or a few days) on refining the itial plot, you will detail your world so much so that moving forward and starting to plan how your player characters will interact with it will be simple.

### The story is a collection of tasks

Once the main plot is complete, and all the elements in it are clear, it is time to list everything the villain needs to do in order to succeed. This is where your player characters start to interact with the plot and the world at large. Each and every step the villain must achieve to win the long term plot are going to be the adventures your player characters may participate into.

### A plot is a long term plan written in pencil

One of the most important aspect of plotting a campaign is to understand that everything you are writing now is just an idea. You still don't know your player characters, their backstories and their dreams. You have no idea how their future actions will impact the villain's plot. This is why your plot and its collection of adventures must be written in pencil. You will change your plot adventures ideas many times, and you should understand that this is the life of a good campaign. There is nothing worse than a game master who can't conceive that their players may not be interested in the order of events.

Remember the golden rule of a good game master. You must embrace change for your players' sake. While you will spend hours plotting and writing, it is their prerogative to decide how to interact with your creation. Trying to force a story down your player's throat is simply wrong. If you want to be in total control of your world and its lore, write a book, because becoming a game master won't be fun, for you nor for your players.

You should start writing the titles of each of these tasks. As before, you should do it in pencil, ready to change everything once your player characters start to interact with your world. The number of adventures you need to plot varies, and depends on how long you want your campaign to last. I generally spend three to five gaming sessions per adventure. Playing once a week, this means that each adventure last one month of play. Considering I mix one adventure related to the master plot to one unrelated to it, this means that if you plan twelve master plot adventures, you expect your campaign to last two full years.

That said, I like to write a few more adventures than strictly necessary. I do it because I know that my player characters will manage to interact with the master plot so much that they will change the shape of the story.

### Multiple plots
If you want to create a world your players will find multi-faceted and complete, you only need to write more than one plot which interacts between each other. While this may sound simple, at least once you master the logic behind how to create a plot, the complexity of multiple plots is exponentials. The number of non player characters, how they interact amongst each other and how these plots will interact together, can be overwhelming. I suggest this approach only if you have mastered the base plot extremely well and you have a group of players ready to embark in an epic, long journey.
