# Jinx

Jinx is a set of minimalist mechanics to run a Role Playing Game. The game is an ability-based tabletop roleplaying game. This initial set of rules is designed to support games set up in the current world. Yet, it is important to understand that Jinx is, first and foremost, a set of mechanics to help telling stories, and can be easily adapted to support other settings. To do this, you just need to change the list of abilities.

## Game Mechanics

The game mechanics are based on abilities. The focus is given to which actions the player characters are able to perform and with which degree of success. An action is resolved by comparing a specific threshold to the ability level summed to a roll of a dice.

Every ability value in Jinx, as well as the thresholds, varies between 0 and 100.

The mechanics define two types of actions: challenged and unchallenged.

### Unchallenged Actions

Unchallenged actions are those a character do without being opposed by another character's action. In this category fall actions as shooting, investigation, swimming and so on. The Storyteller defines a threshold, and the player character should score mor than the threshold by adding 1d20 to their ability value.

`action result = ability + 1d20`

### Challenged Actions

When a character wants to perform an action which another character can oppose with another skill, we have a challenged action. Examples of challenged actions are melee fighting, persuasion vs willpower, 
In a challenged action, instead of comparing the action result to a threshold, we compare two action results: the action and the opposed action.

### Thresholds

In Jinx, a generic thresholds level should be considered as such:

---|---:
Difficulty|Threshold
Daily|15
Simple|25
Difficult|50
Challenging|75
Extreme|85+

### Degree of success

Succeeding in an action is rarely a yes/no result. In Jinx, the result of an action identifies the degree of success or failure. The degree of success is a value that ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 is a minimal success (or failure) while a 5 is a spectacular one. Every 20 points of difference between the threshold and the action result, the degree of success is raised by 1 point.

---|---:
Difference|Degree of Success
0-19|1
20-39|2
40-59|3
60-79|4
80+|5

The degree of success is the multiplier for any weapon damage.

### Critical Roll

Every time a natural 1 or a natural 20 are rolled, the roll is considered critical. A natural 1 will remove 20 points from the character ability value. A natural 20 will add 40 points to it.

### Untrained actions

In addition to a list of abilities, Jinx uses the idea of traits. Each character is defined by three traits: body, mind and spirit. These traits determine the starting point of each ability. If a character is not trained in a specific ability, instead of using their ability value, they will use their trait value and they will have the possibility to become proficient in that ability.
