## Introduction

When I started writing Jinx, I did not think I would have written and entire book. I was looking for some simple mechanics which would allow me to focus more on storytelling than other. I liked the vast availability of D&D, but there were some pet peeves which kept me away from it, namely levels and classes. Alas, I had always been one of those storytellers who preferred characters without labels attached to them. I was more in line with mechanics a-la Call of Cthulhu, but Fantasy has always been a love of mine.

Truth is that I wrote some simple mechanics and I started playing with them. My players were thrown in an intense campaign and, without realising, they became my playtesters. The first good thing is that, by focusing more on the story and less on the rolls, I was able to gently lead them to each rule. The second good thing was that the mechanics worked exactly as expected, and they were smooth and simple to learn, while keeping the flexibility I was looking for.

The book you have in your hand is one of the many iteration in making the rules better and the information more readable. I never thought someone would have read what started as a one-pager mechanics. Nonetheless, I hope you will like it, or that at least it will give you some interesting ideas to work on!

### The goals of Jinx

In the world of Tabletop Role-Playing Games, Jinx is but a drop in an ocean. Yet, it has been written with clear goals in mind:

- provide a minimalistic mechanics that supports storytelling
- define a system to help storytellers to create campaigns and adventures

Jinx focuses more on giving player characters the possibility to grow as complex entities. This means supporting a multi-faceted growth without the need of identifying classes or archetypes. It also support a balanced approach to combat, by making it dangerous.

In the end, what you have to remember is that it will be up to the storyteller to use these rules at the best of their possibility. I have seen fantastic campaigns played by incredible game masters on rubbish rules, but I have very rarely seen bad game masters deliver quality adventures with whichever mechanics.

The final goal of Jinx is to help shape great storytellers, allowing them to focus more on stories and less on rules!

### What is a Role-Playing Game

@TODO

### Settings

This game is based on a fantasy world like the ones in Tolkien's **The Lord of the Ring**,

@TODO

### An example of play

> **Storyteller**: When you reach the base of the tower, you notice two men sitting with their backs on the door.
>
> **Faby**: Are they asleep?
>
> **Storyteller**: No, they are talking amongst each other
>
> **Will**: Can we get close to them without being noticed
>
> **Storyteller**: Not really, especially because they have already spotted you. They are standing up, and you notice that one of the two is adjusting his sword
>
> **Faby**: How far are we from them?
>
> **Storyteller**: They are roughly 20 meters from them. Now that that stood up, you can see they are quite tall. One of them has a sleeveless shirt, and his arms are full of tattoos
>
> **Will**: Do I recognise any of the tattoos?
>
> **Storyteller**: Without any doubt. You have seen them many times during the last war.
>
> **Will**: Shit...
>
> **Faby**: I take my bow out and I aim
>
> **Storyteller**: When they see you taking your bow out they start moving towards you. One of them seems smarter than the other and moves quite erratically, the other focuses on speed
>
> **Will**: I guess Brikoto takes out his long sword
>
> **Faby**: I spend one turn to carefully aim to the idiot running straight towards me
>
> **Storyteller**: He seems to be sure he can reach you before you can let your arrow fly. He is raising his sword while he runs. It is obvious that the other is smarter, as while he is moving towards you, he start shouting.
>
> **Will**: Brikoto moves towards the second man saying "*So much for trying and be quiet...*"
>
> **Faby**: Okado let the arrow fly, and says to Brikoto "*Hey, I told you we should have gone from the other entrance!*"
>
> **Storyteller**: Roll to hit, Faby
>
> **Faby rolls a die**: Okado's ability with the bow is 49, plus 17 of the dice, plus 10 as I was aiming for one turn... I have 74, minus 25 to hit, I have a success of 51. 15 damages times 3, Okado strikes 45 damages with a single arrow!
>
> **Storyteller**: You see the first man running straight towards Okado, that let one of her arrow fly towards him. His velocity is immediately halted when the arrow hits him straight on his head, making him fall heavily on his back. Will, what do you do?
>
> **Will**: running erratically or not, as soon as the second idiot is close, I swing my sword.
>
> **Faby**: I take out my knife and I make sure that the first guy is not going to stand up again.
>
> **Storyteller**: The second man

### Traits, Abilities and Talents

#### Traits

Every character is identified by three main traits.

- **Body** identifies everything related to strength, agility, health.
- **Mind** defines the intellectual capabilities.
- **Spirit** is used for the characters self esteem, confidence and presence.

Every player has 30 points to divide in the three traits of their character. The limit helps create a character that can have strength and weaknesses alike.

#### Abilities

Every character possesses a list of abilities. These are the things a character know how to do. The abilities defines the character, as Jinx does not have the notion of class.

Each ability is linked to one of the three main traits. The trait defines the initial value for each ability.

At the beginning of the game, each character possesses five abilities of their choice. The player has 60 points to distribute in the five abilities, with a limit of 20 points in each ability.

The list of available abilities are found below.

#### Talents

Some abilities, when mastered over 50 points, offers some unique talents. Differently from traits and abilities, talents do not have any value, they are just capabilities that expands the abilities themselves. For example, a character whose melee ability of 50 or more can chose to master a double attack.

The list of talents is available with the list of attributes.

#### List of Abilities

Below you will find a list of abilities available in Jinx. They are divided by their trait and describe any available talent.

### Life Points
Every playing character has 40 life points plus the value of their **Body**. When lost, the life points can be recovered by sleeping or meditating (1 every 6 hours) or through medical treatment.

`life points = 40 + Body`

### Backstory

In Jinx, a character backstory is as important as any other trait or ability, if not more. The guidelines of a player character's backstory should always be agreed with the storyteller. However, it is important for the player to describe their character's backstory. This is a moment in which each player learns about their character and bond with it.

To write a character backstory that is central to your character record sheet, you should follow these steps:

1. Write something about your character demographic
2. Write about your character psychographic information
3. Describe how your character acquired their abilities

#### Start with your demography

When writing your backstory, you should keep well in mind your character's race, gender and general demographic information. This should be the base of the story you are going to tell about your character.

> *Okado* was born in a small village in the east. Her mother was the daughter of a renowned bard, who was singing the praise of the Elven lands. In one of these trips *Alia* fell in love with a human who was hired to protect his father during their journey. The love was, unfortunately, short lived, and when *Okado* was born, her mixed race was seen as a sign of dirt from her grandfather. He could not understand how an elf as beautiful as *Alia* could have accepted to produce such a lesser spawn.
>
>*Okado* did not have the time to grow and speak for herself, because his grandfather gave an ultimatum to her daughter: leave her daughter or lose her parents and status. *Alia* had never been a strong woman, and valued her race more than her daughter.

#### Bring in your psychographic information

Jinx leverages the OCEAN personality definition. It is a very simple way to characterise a person, or a PC in this case, with five simple values. These values, as described in the [psychography](#psychography) part above, identify one characteristic of your character's personality. You should write a small episode linked to each of the detailed traits.

> *Okado* has always been very interested in trying new things, in exploring the unknown. When she was just but a child, she accepted another accolite's bet and jumped on a horse. She was but 6 years old, but found the experience exhilarating. The clerics that looked after her didn't, and punished both for having risked the well being of the horse, not to mention her own neck. However, since that moment, Okado felt a great respect of the mighty beasts, and despite not having one herself, she will always be attracted to their beauty.

#### How were their abilities learned

Every character starts the game with at least 3 ability. Writing how these skills were learned is a fantastic way to give a context to your character. Tell a story about how your character developed.

> *Okado* was raised in a clerical monastery dedicated to *Anshalla* the Goddess of War. The clerics brought her in when she was less than a year old, and she grew in a regimented environment which valued the ability to survive more than love. Everyone in the monastery had do do their part to bring food on the table, and *Okado* soon became *Ithildir* assistant. The old warrior was a solitary woman, and preferred the wilderness to the chitchat of the monastery. She brought *Okado* with her during her excursion, and trained her in the art of surviving and hunting for food.

## Game Mechanics

Jinx is based on simple game mechanics which revolve around a series of abilities each characters has. The abilities define the characters' skillset, and allow them to grow as complex entities. The abilities are based on the fact that we all have some basic traits, and that the more we perform an action, the more skilled we become at it.

In Jinx, every ability is scored in values that range from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the better the character is at that particular ability.

Jinx keeps into account a random opportunity of failure and success in the form of a die which can be rolled and added to the total ability. This signifies the chance and the fortunate or unfortunate conditions. The luck variance can add up to 20 points, which in extreme cases can expand the variance from removing 20 points to adding 40 points to an action.

The goal is to create a realistic approach to how a real person is, with unique skillsets each character has and abilities which grows organically, making the characters progress.

### Performing Actions

Every time a character need to perform an action which is not trivial or impossible, they will have to check if they succeed. There are two type of actions: challenged (*stealth VS awareness*) and unchallenged (*jumping over a fence*).

In both cases, the rules refers to an ability, but the challenge can be done on a trait.

#### Open ended rolls

Every d20 roll is open ended. Every time a 1 is roll, the player should re-roll the dice and subtract the result. Every time a natural 20 is roll, the player should re-roll the dice and add the result.

The open ended roll applies only to the first roll, and not on the re-rolls.

#### Challenged actions

When the action of a character can be challenged by a counter action of another character, then the result of the action is defined by a simple comparison between the action plus 1d20 of the first character and the counter action plus 1d20 of the second character.

The **level of success or failure** is the difference between the two action results.

`success = (ability + 1d20) - (ability + 1d20)`

#### Unchallenged actions

Unchallenged actions are those actions which are not opposed by another character. The storyteller should define a threshold that the character should overcome. This threshold define (in percentage value) the complexity of the action.

The action result is calculated by adding the ability or trait of the action plus 1d20.

The **level of success or failure** is the difference between the threshold and the action result.

`success = (ability + 1d20) - threshold`

#### Threshold

Jinx is based on a percentile complexity level. Every time an action is performed, the total result identifies the degree of success on a scale between 0 and 100. It is therefore simple to identify threshold vales the storyteller should use to challenge a character's action.

Threshold|Difficulty level
---:|---
10|Mundane difficulty, almost everyone can do it
25|Normal challenge, with a bit of effort you can do it
50|Difficult, you need to know your ability in order to succeed
75|Exceptional, only those who master the ability can do it
100+|Inhuman, the few that make it are the top of the top

The threshold is set by the game master, and indicates the level of success the action should reach in order to be successful.

### Combat

Similarly to every action, the result of an attack depends if the attack is challenged (*punching VS dodging*) or unchallenged (*shooting another character*).

In Jinx, fighting is dangerous. The game itself is designed to make combat a serious action with dire consequences. By no means we want to avoid combat situations, on the contrary we believe they balance a well though-through campaign. Yet, Jinx is a role-playing game which focuses on storytelling and abilities. Combat is no more important than any other skill.

#### Challenged Attacks
When two characters are fighting and the defending character has an ability which can challenge the attacker, then the attack result is defined by a simple comparison between the attack ability plus 1d20 and the defending ability plus 1d20.

The **level of success or failure** is the difference between the two results.

`success = (attacking ability + 1d20) - (defending ability + 1d20)`

#### Unchallenged Attacks
When the attack of a character cannot be actively defended by the other character, the difficulty is derived by a base challenge factor of **25**. This can receive a positive or negative modifier depending on the opponent apparent size and speed.

`success = (attacking ability + 1d20) - 25`

#### Attack modifiers
The attack success can be modified by a series of factors. Some of them make it easy to hit or deliver damages, while others can make it more challenging to attack.

Please note that these modifiers are optional, and should never slow down the game. It is down to the storyteller to decide how much to involve the modifiers. Our approach is simple: if it makes the game more interesting, use them, otherwise drop them.

size of target|modifier
---|---:
Tiny|-10
Small|-5
Medium|0
Big|+5
Huge|+10

Remember that a positive modifier makes it easier for the character to hit.

speed of target|modifier
---|---:
Still|+5
Walking|0
Trotting|-5
Running|-10

To balance the game in terms of challenging the hand to hand combat, the melee combat and the ranged combat, the following modifiers should be applied to ranged combat

Distance to target|modifier
---|---:
0-15m|0
16m-30m|-5
31m-45m|-10
46m+|-15

Last, but not least, you should consider the challenge of hitting a subject who is partially covered

Coverage|modifier
---|---:
Part (25%)|-5
Half(50%)|-10
Sensible(75%+)|-15

#### Damages
Every weapon has a fixed amount of damages it inflicts. The damage receives a modifier depending on the success of the attack.

success|damage modifier
---|---:
1-10|1/2
11-20|1
21-30|1.5
31-40|2
41-50|2.5
51+|3

#### Ablative armours
Jinx uses the idea of ablative armours, which are protections that absorb the damages in lieu of the character wearing it. The armours have a fixed amount of protection, which is lost every time a damage is absorbed.

The ablative armour can absorb only a maximum of damage in a single attack. Each armour should specify this value.

Every time the damage caused by a single attack is bigger than the amount of damages the armour can substain in a single attack, the rest of the damages are passed to the character.

Each character can try and repair a damaged armour using the Armoury skill.

### Damages and Death

A character life points are indicative of their psycho-physical health. Every time a character is injured, debilitated or psychologically damaged, their life points are lowered to reflect the character status.

#### Effects of damages on character

When a character has suffered damages, they won't be able to perform as well as they would when in optimal conditions. The more the character is hurt, the more challenging their action become.

The table below indicates how the amount of psychophysical damages affects the character ability to perform any action.

damages|action modifier
---|---:
0-20|0
21-25|-5
26-30|-10
31-35|-15
36+|-20

#### Unconsciousness

When a character reaches between 0 and -30 life points, they are rendered unconscious. They can only be revived with medicine, potions or spells. Every round unconscious, every player character should roll a body trait check against a threshold of **25**, or lose 10 life points.

#### Death

A character dies when one of the following condition happens:
- they reach -31 points or less
- when they are unconscious, an attacker announces a *coup de grace* on them

### Magic

@TODO

In world where magic can be used, Jinx supports the idea of Vancian Magic. Every spellcaster must learn their spells every day, and they dissolve from their memories after being cast. Hence, magic users must learn the spell before being able to cast it again. Magic users can learn a single spell for longer, which means they are able to cast it more than once.

Each spell has a complexity level. Spellcasters have the ability to learn and cast spells of complexity lower than their ability. Each day, spellcasters can memorise a set maximum amount of spells per complexity;


Magic ability VS spell complexity|Spell per complexity level
---:|:---
0/+4|1
+5/+9|2
+10/+15|3
+15|4


Magic Ability|10|20|30|40|50|60|70|80|90
---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:
10-14|1|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
15-19|2|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
20-24|3|1|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
25-29|4|2|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
30-34|4|3|1|-|-|-|-|-|-
35-39|4|4|2|-|-|-|-|-|-
40-44|4|4|3|1|-|-|-|-|-
45-49|4|4|4|2|-|-|-|-|-
50-54|4|4|4|3|1|-|-|-|-
55-59|4|4|4|4|2|-|-|-|-
60-64|4|4|4|4|3|1|-|-|-
65-69|4|4|4|4|4|2|-|-|-
70-74|4|4|4|4|4|3|1|-|-
75-79|4|4|4|4|4|4|2|-|-
80-84|4|4|4|4|4|4|3|1|-
85-89|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|2|-
90-94|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|3|1
95-99|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|2
100|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|3

Which means that a character with a magical ability of 33 will be able to memorise 4 spells of complexity level 10, 3 spells of level 20 and 1 spell of level 30


## Character Progression

In Jinx, character progresses by growing their abilities through experience and repetition. When the player characters use any ability, they should mark them. At the end of each session, each player character can try and raise the ability level.

In order to improve their abilities, player characters have to roll a d100 and score higher than their current ability skill. If a character has successfully used an ability more than once, every success after the first give them a bonus of +10 to the roll. The amount of progression of each ability depends on the success score of the roll.

'success = d100 + bonus - current ability value'

### Progression steps

A player character who successfully increase the value of an ability will add a set of points based on the table below.

Progression success|Ability increase
---|---
1-10|+1
11-25|+2
26-35|+3
36+|+5

## The World

*In the first version of Jinx, this part is left intentionally blank*

## Storytelling

The idea of being a "good storyteller" boils down to be able to create world and stories your players are going to love. If your players can't stop talking about what happened in the last session and they come back for more, you know you are doing a great job.

Yet, the road to having fun, for a storyteller, is not as simple as the one our players have. There are a lot of things that go behind the scenes of a good role-playing game adventure, and many of them fall on the storyteller's shoulder. While role-playing is a group effort, and the final story is written by the players, it is your responsibility to lie the foundations for your players to build on.

In this part of the book we will do deeper in the things we do to create unforgettable stories. We will I've you access to all our secrets.

#### The differences between a storyteller and a player
Yet, the road to having fun, for a storyteller, is not as simple as the one our players have. There are a lot of things that go behind the scenes of a good role-playing game adventure, and many of them fall on the storyteller's shoulder.

In this part of the book we will do deeper in the things we do to create unforgettable stories. We will I've you access to all our secrets.

#### The golden rule of a good game master

A good game master is the one that is able to make their player characters interact with and shape a story which everyone love.

This means that your role of unsung hero will require you to change your plots, stories, ideas and expectations. Become comfortable with changes, because that's the only way you can be a good game master.

#### Sandboxing or Railroading?

Online it is easy to find a holy war raging between supporters of sandboxing games and "railroaders". Jinx is neither, but sits in the middle. A campaign well plotted and a flexible approach to adventures, which keeps into consideration the players as the most essential elements of a role-playing game, is what Jinx supports. In realising that both sides have pro and con, we take an approach which enhances storytelling and fun. Please do remember that in role-playing games there are no winning conditions, there is fun.

If you are new to the terms "sandboxing" and "railroading", then you have an advantage, as you won't have to forget what you have learned. However, should you be a strong supporter of one or the other, the advice we can give you is to open your mind and read this book. If, then, you'll feel that your way is the right way, by any means, please do play as you love. What we know is that every game master, dungeon master or storyteller has their own fabulous way of running a game. The important thing is to do it.

#### Failing to plan means planning to fail

It does not matter if you are a strong believer in a sandbox in approach, or if you agree with a more structured approach as this game preaches. The reality is that if you, as storyteller, fail to plan means you will let our players down. Your role is critical to the success of the game. If you work out your story or world well, your players will help you shape the adventures their character will live. If you don't, improvisation alone won't be enough to entertain your players.

#### The building blocks of a story

In the next sub chapters, we will often refer to a lot of terms which every seasoned storyteller knows. Feel free to keep these terms in mind as an introduction to what we are ping to dig deeper later.

**Storyteller** or **Game Master**: a player who is responsible to manage the game and set the story the player characters are going to live.

**Player**: a real person who plays a role-playing game.

**Character** or **Player Character** or **PC**: a fictional figure which the player controls during the game. This is not a real person.

**Campaign**: a large and complex story arc that spans across many adventures, and that lasts months, if not years, of play.

**Adventures**: a story split amongst a finite number of sessions which tells a self contained story, which can be integral part of a campaign.

**Session**: a few continuative hours of play, where the player characters are exposed to a series of events.

**Event**: something that happens during a role-playing game session and that is designer to involve a player character in the story.

**Non Player Character** or **NPC**: a fictional figure controlled by the storyteller. Every single living being in a story which is not a PC. These characters are controlled by the storyteller.

**Location**: A place where your player characters can live their adventures. It can be as small as a room, or as large as an empire.

**Faction**: Many times Non Player Characters group together and form groups. They can be a guild, as well as a crime syndicate.

#### The Assumption of Heroism

Combat is not a pivotal point in Jinx. It is different from all the other abilities for the way it is dealt with, but it should not be the most important part in the adventures. This is why the combat should be regulated by the **Assumption of Heroism**. This is the idea that, by default, the player characters win. This does not mean that the combat should not be dangerous to the player characters, on the contrary the risk of death should loom over every combat, it simply means that the NPCs must prove themselves extraordinary to win.

The Assumption of Heroism means that the storyteller should allow any NPCs to be able to perform only a limited number of combat round before being defeated, either by being killed by the PCs or by fleeing the scene.

This rule applies exclusively if the PCs manage to hit their foe. A PCs who does not try to actively engage in combat, or that does not hit the opponent, does not fall in the *heroism* category.

As storyteller, it your duty to understand how long a combat should last, and how the foes will challenge the PCs. Planning, even in this case, is paramount to create a positive experience for your players. What will the NPCs do in every round they have available? How will they play their cards? You should try and prepare these details before each combat, but adapt them during it to shape the game around your player characters' actions.

#### Setting thresholds

Jinx bases many ability checks on a threshold scale that you, the storyteller, need to identifying. While using a custom selection of the threshold is a challenge for new storytellers, it is a weapon you can use to influence a game for the enjoyment of everyone. Setting a threshold value is more art than science. With experience it become easier to set the values.

But let's go back to the advantages of having a variable challenge. Let's say your players have managed to fight their ways through countless challenges, and they are now trying to sneakily pass through a gate without being spotted. You build up the tension, you describe the world around them and then ask a *stealth* check. The PC rolls a success of 72, while you had set a threshold of 75. What would happen if they fail? Maybe the story will be best for everyone if the PC had succeeded. So you narrate the PC action, build up the tension, and finish the description with a judgment call if to make the action succeed or not.

As the storyteller, it is your call if to openly announce the threshold before the roll, or if to keep it secret. The first is a build up on the dice, the second on you. What we mean is that by announcing the threshold, the players will focus on the dice to understand if their action succeeds. On the contrary, if you are keeping the threshold secret, they will tell you their degree of success, but you can them play the action resolution epically.

> *Player*: Groncon runs on the collapsing bridge, and jumps towards the tower, trying to grapple himself on one of the window ledges
>
> *Storyteller*: You run as fast as you can, wailing your arms trying not to lose balance, and when you feel the bridge finally giving in, you jump as far as you can. Please give me a check on Athletics
>
> *Player*: I have an Athletics ability of 47 and I rolled a 17, for a total of 64...
>
> *Storyteller look at the players for a moment*: Groncon jumps from the collapsing bridge. Behind him the three  orcs realise too late the fate that awaits them. With panic in their eyes, they try desperately to stop and run back, but it is too late and they fall in the chasm below. In the meantime Groncon, extending his arms, tries desperately to reach one of the window ledges. *Storyteller pauses for a moment, looking at his players* He stops just a few inches short from the wall... luckily for him, the ledges are just those few inches deep to allow him to barely hold himself to them. Groncon *the storyteller turns to him* you hold yourself with your nails, and you hit the wall rather violently. Yet, after few seconds of fear, you realise you managed to escape the three orcs.

### Campaigns

#### Always start with the end in mind

A very important element while writing campaigns and adventures, you need to start from the end. If you are planning an epic campaign, the first thing you should start writing is the end. Considering how things turn out makes it easier to plan how they started.

#### Plotting a Campaign

The main idea behind a great campaign is simple: you should be able to create a compelling, detailed background plot. Now, what many storytellers don't understand about a campaign is that its plot is neither about the player characters nor it is the story the player characters will go through. While this may sound strange, especially after I mentioned that everything should be around your player and their characters, you need to realise one thing. Your player characters only exist in a world, and the way you allow them to live is to have a world which can live without them. The campaign is your world without the player characters. It is the background upon which they will become heroes of villains. If you have this plot, you can allow them to interact with an exciting world.

Moreover, when you consider this plot, we find it is always best to write it from a villain perspective. While you can write a plot from the perspective of an ally, this does not give your player characters enough interesting spots to interact with the plot. The campaign is therefore a long story arc about a villain and what they want to achieve.

Put your thinking cap on, forget any player and start planning what your world will go through in the next months.

#### The master plot

The master plot is a simple sentence that identifies, without describing any details, the main villain and its goal.

> Lord Enoch wants to gain the throne of the Empire of Wardwore by either buying the support of the high council or killing those who oppose him.

Don't expect your master plot to tell you more than what's necessary. Your first plot does not have to be interesting. A master plot is just the baseline of what the world will go through.

#### The story is a collection of information

Another common pitfall some storytellers make, is to think that they can grow the story and learn about it at the same time the players do. This is a common mistake you can sort quickly. Imagine yourself as the writer of a intriguing spy story. You, the writer, must know everything about the story. Starting to write the novel without knowing the ins and outs, the who's who, is a path to failure. In the same way, as a storyteller, you should know everything concerning your campaign.

#### Know everything and everyone in your plot

Now that your master plot is ready, it is time to put it in context. This means starting reading your master plot stopping and clarifying, every time you can, the following:

- What
- Who
- Where
- When
- How

This means that, starting from the main plot, every time you meet a detail which is not clear enough about which you could answer one or the magic questions above, you should write a bit more. Consider also that the answers you will give may contain other details you should clarify. This becomes a '*fishbone*' set of answers which will help you describe your campaign in great details.

Let's start analysing our master plot, stopping every time a detail can be clarified.

@TODO

`Lord Enoch` (Ok, who is he? Where does he live? What does he stand for? How has he gained power?) `wants to gain the throne of the Empire of Wardwore` (wait, what is the Empire of Wardwore? How is it ruled? Who is the current Emperor? Where is it in the world? Who are the main figures in it?) `by either buying` (How do the money he has come from? How much money does he have? Where does he keep them? When did he gain them?) `the support of the high council` (What is the High Council? How does it work? Who is in charge of it? Who is in it? How does the Emperor treat the High Council? When was it formed?) `or killing those who oppose him` (Who want to oppose him? Why do they want to fight him? How many there are? How is he going to kill them?)

The questions we asked in this example are only a minimal part of those we should ask. You need to ask as many questions as possible, and you also have to start asking the same questions when you get your first answers. Let's say that one of the members of the High Council who is going to oppose Lord Enoch is Lady Elgolath. You need to start asking the same questions about her.

By starting from a single master plot and by exploring all the details will begin creating your world in minute details. This is what you want because by spending a few hours (or a few days) on refining the initial plot, you will detail your world so much so that moving forward and starting to plan how your player characters will interact with it will be simple.

#### How to make a campaign come to life

A campaign, for what you have written so far, is just a master plot with a lot of details. It is time to start planning how to make this come to life and how to let player characters interact with it. I know that for many people this is going to be a let-down, but a campaign is just a list of adventures. And not complete adventures, but adventures plots. Once you have the master plot, you need to ask yourself: what are the steps the main villain or their henchmen need to go through in order to succeed?

Remember, what you need to write are just a set of titles and some notes to make you remember what the title is about!

Let's make things simple and bring back Lord Enoch, always remembering to start from the end.

Obviously, the last part of the campaign is when Lord Enoch wins. The coronation is the obvious finale should everything go as he wishes! This is the last moment in which someone willing to oppose him can stop the madness of such a man becoming Emperor.

> Lord Enoch coronation

A man like him is sure to be willing to send a clear message to everyone who dare to oppose his power. As we said that Lady Elgolath is clearly against him, what about having her publicly executed for something wrong she has done?

> The execution of Lady Elgolath

Lady Elgolath has done something wrong, but seen that Lord Enoch is still not the Emperor, he must have been careful to pass things as very legal, so Lady Elgolath could have gone through a trial before being executed.

> The treason trial

What if Lady Elgolath was betrayed by an old friend who was bought by Lord Enoch? This can be an interesting twist of events.

> Betraying the high council

Let's say that to gain power, Lord Enoch had to eliminate two adversaries? One is Lady Elgolath, maybe the other is called Lord Mutwen. Hey, let's say that he "was" called Lord Mutwen.

> Murder on the hill

Before starting to eliminate those who are against him, Lord Enoch must have hired an assassin.

> Hiring the assassin

And before that, Lord Enoch must have gained a large sum of money to support his work.

> Breaking in the Imperial Coinage

We have always considered the campaign from when Lord Enoch started pulling all the strings, but maybe before that he wanted to make sure that his name was high up in the list of the possible successors to the throne. Maybe a lavish party where politics were drawn.

> The Mid Summer Ball



#### Write in pencil

One of the challenges I see in some campaigns, or adventures, is that they are written in stone. As the storyteller has invested time in creating their campaigns or adventures, they expect the player characters to follow them precisely. This is where the idea of "Railroading" comes in, and where campaigns and adventures stop being fun to play.

However you believe your campaigns or Adventures will be played, your player characters will find a way to do things you haven't considered, derailing your great plans. Remember, this is how it is supposed to be. Your players have the same ability to shape the story you have. They play their characters for specific reasons, and you cannot expect them to behave like characters in a book. The only place where it happens are books, and if you expect it, you should rather write a novel than be a storyteller.

You should write everything in pencil, at least in your mind. This means, be ready to change your mind over and over again. This mental attitude will help you being a better storyteller.

One of the most crucial aspects of plotting a campaign is to understand that everything you are writing now is just an idea. You still don't know your player characters, their backstories and their dreams. You have no idea how their future actions will impact the villain's plot. This is why your plot and its collection of adventures should still be just an idea. You will change your plot adventures ideas many times, and you should understand that this is the life of a good campaign. There is nothing worse than a game master who can't conceive that their players may not be interested in the order of events.

Remember the golden rule of a good game master. You must embrace change for your players' sake. While you will spend hours plotting and writing, it is their prerogative to decide how to interact with your creation. Trying to force a story down your player's throat is merely wrong.

### Adventures

Once you have your campaign master plot laid out, it is time to think about all the great adventures your player characters can live. How are their lives going to interact with your campaign, and how are they going to be an integral part of how the world you prepared is going to be shaped?

We think that the most important thing to understand is that being the Game Master does not need being the one who decides how the history you will be narrating will come out. Your players are as involved in shaping the story as you are, and you should remember this in the way you adapt the adventures on their choices. Remember, always write in pencil and embrace change!

#### Type of Adventures in a Campaign

@TODO Campaign Adventures

The first thing you need to understand is that, despite your campaign being the master plot shaping your characters' futures, the campaign linked to the campaign plot is not the only one existing. On the contrary, focussing exclusively on those would rob your players from a lot of fun. Imagine how incredibly strong are the adventures who dig into the characters' past and background. When you take the time to listen to your players and shape the future of their characters based on the back stories they wrote, you create a world they are going to love.

#### The Story Circle

Please keep in mind that this method to create an adventure is based both on a structured and well-known storytelling technique, as well as an easy to use anatomy. It all starts with Dan Harmon's "Story Circle".  Dan Harmond simplified Joseph Campbell "Monomyth" also known as "The Hero's Journey".
Dan Harmond divides every story in a circle identified by eight steps. This Story Circle can be applied to every story in every media. Hence it can be used to create amazing adventures whose story will relate to your players.

Before describing every step, let me dig a bit deeper in the circle and how it can be divided. You will understand why I try to divide my adventures into four sessions. If you divide the story circle horizontally, the top part is the start and the end of the story, while the bottom part identifies the characters' growth and change. The ordinary versus the special, life versus death, consciousness versus unconsciousness or order versus chaos. If you give the right rhythm to your adventure, this will be felt by your players, as their characters were in a great film. When the characters move from one semicircle to the other, they evolve.
By dividing the story circle vertically as well, you identify four intersections and four spaces.  These are the main parts of our adventures. Every time one of the lines intersect the circle, you define a story point, additionally, between each point, you can identify another story point. With this method, you can identify a total of 8 story points. These points will navigate a hero through their story, piece by piece.

Dan Harmond named each of the 8 points:
1. YOU - A character is in their comfort zone
2. NEED - They want something
3. GO - They enter an unfamiliar situation
4. SEARCH - They adapt to it
5. FIND - Get what they wanted
6. TAKE - pay a heavy price for it
7. RETURN - Then return to their familiar situation
8. CHANGE - Having changed

Every time a character crosses one of the lines, it advances in the story. Each crossing is a major drama point. In point 3 a hero enters an unfamiliar situation and adapts to the new "norm", often struggling to do so. Point 5 define the inner struggle of the hero.

For those of you who are used to the "Three Acts Adventure", the first quadrant identifies the first act, ending with the adventure hook. The second and third quadrant identify the second act, with the midpoint in the middle and the first failed attempt to end it. The last quadrant is the third act, where the heroes win.

But how do you apply Dan Harmond's study to your adventure? Or, to better put it, how do you create a great adventure using Harmond's study?

#### Type of events

In my experience, you can divide events into five main categories:

- **GM time** From time to time, you need the space to present something to your players. These are events where there is no interaction with the PCs, but they give you the time to give the PCs a frame of reference or the right amount of information.

- **Planning and Recaps** These are the events in which the player characters discuss amongst themselves. They are extremely important for the players to cement the information they received. You have to remember that the players do not have all the information you have as a Game Master. You have to allow them time for pure roleplay and information analysis. The time for these type of events is extremely variable and depends on your players. One party I had wanted nothing more than a constant, collective brainstorm, investing a huge amount of time in pure discussions. Another was very action-oriented, which meant these events were very short. You need to know about your party!

- **Exploration** Exploring a new environment can be exciting and can give you time to reorganise the session time, change the adventure on the fly and give something to your player characters. This kind of events' duration is entirely up to you. You can make the are to be explored dry of information, keeping the event short, or you can allow your player characters to dissect an entire Star Destroyer piece by piece. Use the exploration events wisely though: make sure your PCs don't get bored and frustrated because they can't find anything.

- **Action** This type of event is about doing something. What I like about it is that they are predictable in terms of results and duration. You should know what's the goal of the action and how much time should it take for you to make the PCs achieve (or fail).

- **Encounter** Here we land in the most exciting types of events: the player characters interact with other NPCs. Of course, you can divide an encounter into two different categories: social interactions or combat situations.

  - **Social Interactions** my favourite encounters. You can dispense information, taunt your player character, make them fall in love or talk with their archnemesis. Whatever is in your NPCs arsenal comes through. This is because I am not a fighting-heavy game master, but your miles may vary. The key element for social interaction is the quality of your NPCs, their three-dimensionality. You are generally in charge of the timing of these situations. Like in any situation in which you are the person timing it, make sure not to stretch it too much or making it too dry. If you are an inexperienced game master, give yourself time.

  - **Combat** While I am not a fighting-heavy game master, I still believe that combat situations are great to keep the level of excitement elevated. There is nothing better than a spike of adrenaline to shake a soporiferous session. But please, remember that even your monsters are NPCs, give them a three-dimensional feel to it. This is why I despise random encounters: because they have no reason to exist apart from having a useless fight.

Now that we have explored the types of events you can fill your story with, let's go back to our examples so I can show my thought process.
