# Jinx

Jinx is a set of minimalist mechanics to run a Role Playing Game. The game is an ability-based tabletop roleplaying game. This initial set of rules is designed to support games set up in the current world. Yet, it is important to understand that Jinx is, first and foremost, a set of mechanics to help telling stories, and can be easily adapted to support other settings. To do this, you just need to change the list of abilities.

Jinx is a minimal ruleset which will help you run your plotted campaigns. It is a framework which is aimed to help Storytellers to resolve actions and to help characters grow. What you are reading is not a full-fledged role playing game, but you can adapt it to every setting you like.

## Game Mechanics

The game mechanics are based on abilities. The focus is given to which actions the player characters are able to perform and with which degree of success. An action is resolved by comparing a specific threshold to the ability level summed to a roll of a dice.

Every ability value in Jinx, as well as the thresholds, varies between 0 and 100.

The mechanics define two types of actions: challenged and unchallenged.

### Unchallenged Actions

Unchallenged actions are those a character do without being opposed by another character's action. In this category fall actions as shooting, investigation, swimming and so on. The Storyteller defines a threshold, and the player character should score mor than the threshold by adding 1d20 to their ability value.

`action result = ability + 1d20`

### Challenged Actions

When a character wants to perform an action which another character can oppose with another skill, we have a challenged action. Examples of challenged actions are melee fighting, persuasion vs willpower, 
In a challenged action, instead of comparing the action result to a threshold, we compare two action results: the action and the opposed action.

### Thresholds

In Jinx, a generic thresholds level should be considered as such:

---|---:
Difficulty|Threshold
Daily|15
Simple|25
Difficult|50
Challenging|75
Extreme|85+

### Degree of success

Succeeding in an action is rarely a yes/no result. In Jinx, the result of an action identifies the degree of success or failure. The degree of success is a value that ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 is a minimal success (or failure) while a 5 is a spectacular one. Every 20 points of difference between the threshold and the action result, the degree of success is raised by 1 point.

---|---:
Difference|Degree of Success
0-19|1
20-39|2
40-59|3
60-79|4
80+|5

The degree of success is the multiplier for any weapon damage.

### Critical Roll

Every time a natural 1 or a natural 20 are rolled, the roll is considered critical. A natural 1 will remove 20 points from the character ability value. A natural 20 will add 40 points to it.

### Untrained actions

In addition to a list of abilities, Jinx uses the idea of traits. Each character is defined by three traits: body, mind and spirit. These traits determine the starting point of each ability. If a character is not trained in a specific ability, instead of using their ability value, they will use their trait value and they will have the possibility to become proficient in that ability.

### A note on combat

Combat is no different than any other action in Jinx. Someone expert in melee can attack or parry if attacked. There is no initiative or rounds; players declare their actions and the actions are carried out in the order in which they are declared. If a single character wants to do multiple actions in comparison with other 

## Character Creation

There are two element of a character creation: boring numbers and exciting stories. The mechanics of the games help define a character through a series of stats which identifies each character's ability. Yet, the most important part in the creation of a character is their backstory and their personality.

### Traits

The foundation of a character are their traits. Each character has 30 points to distribute between the three traits

- Body : the natural level of a character's physical prowess
- Mind : the logical ability of a character
- Spirit : a character's attunement to the world of feelings

### Abilities

In Jinx, abilities are the cornerstone of the action resolution. Each ability belongs to one of the three traits. Each character starts their journey with a total of 60 points to distribute amongst their abilities. The starting value of each ability is the value of the trait the ability belongs to. A character can distribute the points in how many abilities they feel like; however, the player cannot assign more than 20 points to a single ability.

Deciding how to distribute points is an art more than a science. Putting a few points in many abilities may generate a jack of all trades which is the master of none. On the other side picking only three abilities maxed out to 20 points each will generate strong weaknesses in the character. As a rule of thumb, picking 6 abilities and distributing the points amongst those generates a rounded, balanced character with strength and weaknesses alike.

### Backstory

### Character psychology

### Life and Death

### Character's strength

The initial 60 points define a character as a beginner. This is the default starting point for each character; however, it is at the Storyteller discretion to alter this value. Offering more points to the players will generate stronger characters. A character with 120 points to distribute is relatively powerful, while one with 150 or more is extremely powerful. One element to keep into consideration is the limit of 20 points per ability, which cease to be relevant if the Storyteller decides to awards more point for the characters creation.
