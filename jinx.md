## Introduction

### What is a Role-Playing Game

### Settings

This game is based on a fantasy world like the ones in Tolkien's **The Lord of the Ring**,

### An example of play

## Character creation

### Demography

#### Races

##### Humans

##### Elves

##### Dwarves

##### Halflings

##### Orcs

##### Half-Elves

### Psychography

### Traits, Abilities and Life Points

### Backstory

## Game Mechanics

### Performing Actions

Every time a character need to perform an action which is not trivial or impossible, they will have to check if they succeed. There are two type of actions: challenged (*stealth VS awareness*) and unchallenged (*jumping over a fence*).

In both cases, the rules refers to an ability, but the challenge can be done on a trait.

#### Open ended rolls

Every d20 roll is open ended. Every time a 1 is roll, the player should re-roll the dice and subtract the result. Every time a natural 20 is roll, the player should re-roll the dice and add the result.

The open ended roll applies only to the first roll, and not on the re-rolls.

#### Challenged actions

When the action of a character can be challenged by a counter action of another character, then the result of the action is defined by a simple comparison between the action plus 1d20 of the first character and the counter action plus 1d20 of the second character.

The **level of success or failure** is the difference between the two action results.

`success = (ability + 1d20) - (ability + 1d20)`

#### Unchallenged actions

Unchallenged actions are those actions which are not opposed by another character. The storyteller should define a threshold that the character should overcome. This threshold define (in percentage value) the complexity of the action.

The action result is calculated by adding the ability or trait of the action plus 1d20.

The **level of success or failure** is the difference between the threshold and the action result.

`success = (ability + 1d20) - threshold`

#### Threshold

Jinx is based on a percentile complexity level. Every time an action is performed, the total result identifies the degree of success on a scale between 0 and 100. It is therefore simple to identify threshold vales the storyteller should use to challenge a character's action.

Threshold|Difficulty level
---:|---
10|Mundane difficulty, almost everyone can do it
25|Normal challenge, with a bit of effort you can do it
50|Difficult, you need to master your ability in order to succeed
75|Exceptional, only few people can do it
100+|Inhuman, the few that make it are the top

The threshold is set by the game master, and indicates the level of success the action should reach in order to be successful.

### Combat

### Damages and Death

A character life points are indicative of their psycho-physical health. Every time a character is injured, debilitated or psychologically damaged, their life points are lowered to reflect the character status.

#### Effects of damages on character

When a character has suffered damages, they won't be able to perform as well as they would when in optimal conditions. The more the character is hurt, the more challenging their action become.

The table below indicates how the amount of psychophysical damages affects the character ability to perform any action.

damages|action modifier
---|---:
0-20|0
21-25|-5
26-30|-10
31-35|-15
36+|-20

#### Unconsciousness

When a character reaches between 0 and -30 life points, they are rendered unconscious. They can only be revived with medicine, potions or spells. Every round unconscious, every player character should roll a body trait check against a threshold of **25**, or lose 10 life points.

#### Death

A character dies when one of the following condition happens:
- they reach -31 points or less
- when they are unconscious, an attacker announces a *coup de grace* on them


### Magic

## The World

*In the first version of Jinx, this part is left intentionally blank*

## Storytelling

### Building dreams 101

#### The differences between a storyteller and a player

#### The golden rule of a good game master

#### Sandboxing or Railroading?

#### Failing to plan means planning to fail

It does not matter if you are a strong believer in a sandbox in approach, or if you agree with a more structured approach as this game preaches. The reality is that if you, as storyteller, fail to plan means you will let our players down. Your role is critical to the success of the game. If you work out your story or world well, your players will help you shape the adventures their character will live. If you don't, improvisation alone won't be enough to entertain your players.

#### The building blocks of a story

#### Setting thresholds

Jinx bases many ability checks on a threshold scale that you, the storyteller, need to identifying. While using a custom selection of the threshold is a challenge for new storytellers, it is a weapon you can use to influence a game for the enjoyment of everyone. Setting a threshold value is more art than science. With experience it become easier to set the values.

But let's go back to the advantages of having a variable challenge. Let's say your players have managed to fight their ways through countless challenges, and they are now trying to sneakily pass through a gate without being spotted. You build up the tension, you describe the world around them and then ask a *stealth* check. The PC rolls a success of 72, while you had set a threshold of 75. What would happen if they fail? Maybe the story will be best for everyone if the PC had succeeded. So you narrate the PC action, build up the tension, and finish the description with a judgment call if to make the action succeed or not.

As the storyteller, it is your call if to openly announce the threshold before the roll, or if to keep it secret. The first is a build up on the dice, the second on you. What we mean is that by announcing the threshold, the players will focus on the dice to understand if their action succeeds. On the contrary, if you are keeping the threshold secret, they will tell you their degree of success, but you can them play the action resolution epically.

> *Player*: Groncon runs on the collapsing bridge, and jumps towards the tower, trying to grapple himself on one of the window ledges
>
> *Storyteller*: You run as fast as you can, wailing your arms trying not to lose balance, and when you feel the bridge finally giving in, you jump as far as you can. Please give me a check on Athletics
>
> *Player*: I have an Athletics ability of 47 and I rolled a 17, for a total of 64...
>
> *Storyteller look at the players for a moment*: Groncon jumps from the collapsing bridge. Behind him the three  orcs realise too late the fate that awaits them. With panic in their eyes, they try desperately to stop and run back, but it is too late and they fall in the chasm below. In the meantime Groncon, extending his arms, tries desperately to reach one of the window ledges. *Storyteller pauses for a moment, looking at his players* He stops just a few inches short from the wall... luckily for him, the ledges are just those few inches deep to allow him to barely hold himself to them. Groncon *the storyteller turns to him* you hold yourself with your nails, and you hit the wall rather violently. Yet, after few seconds of fear, you realise you managed to escape the three orcs.
