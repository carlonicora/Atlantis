### Magic

@TODO

In a world where magic can be used, Jinx supports the idea of Vancian Magic. Every spellcaster must learn their spells every day, and they dissolve from their memories after being cast. Hence, magic users must learn the spell before being able to cast it again. Magic users can learn a single spell for longer, which means they are able to cast it more than once.

Each spell has a complexity level. Spellcasters have the ability to learn and cast spells of complexity lower than their ability. Each day, spellcasters can memorise a set maximum amount of spells per complexity;

95-99|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|4|2

Which means that a character with a magical ability of 33 will be able to memorise 4 spells of complexity level 10, 3 spells of level 20 and 1 spell of level 30
