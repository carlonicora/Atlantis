### Damages and Death

A character life points are indicative of their psycho-physical health. Every time a character is injured, debilitated or psychologically damaged, their life points are lowered to reflect the character status. 

#### Effects of damages on character

When a character has suffered damages, they won't be able to perform as well as they would when in optimal conditions. The more the character is hurt, the more challenging their action become.

The table below indicates how the amount of psychophysical damages affects the character ability to perform any action.

damages|action modifier
---|---:
0-20|0
21-25|-5
26-30|-10
31-35|-15
36+|-20

#### Unconsciousness

When a character reaches between 0 and -30 life points, they are rendered unconscious. They can only be revived with medicine, potions or spells. Every round unconscious, every player character should roll a body trait check against a threshold of **25*, or lose 10 life points.

#### Death

A character dies when one of the following condition happens:
- they reach -31 points or less
- when they are unconscious, an attacker announces a *coup de grace* on them

## Storytelling

### Building dreams 101

#### The differences between a storyteller and a player

#### The golden rule of a good game master

#### Sandboxing or Railroading?

#### Failing to plan means planning to fail

It does not matter if you are a strong believer in a sandbox in approach, or if you agree with a more structured approach as this game preaches. The reality is that if you, as storyteller, fail to plan means you will let our players down. Your role is critical to the success of the game. If you work out your story or world well, your players will help you shape the adventures their character will live. If you don't, improvisation alone won't be enough to entertain your players.
