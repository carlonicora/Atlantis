## Storytelling

### Building dreams 101

#### The differences between a storyteller and a player

#### The golden rule of a good game master

#### Sandboxing or Railroading?

#### Failing to plan means planning to fail

It does not matter if you are a strong believer in a sandbox in approach, or if you agree with a more structured approach as this game preaches. The reality is that if you, as storyteller, fail to plan means you will let our players down. Your role is critical to the success of the game. If you work out your story or world well, your players will help you shape the adventures their character will live. If you don't, improvisation alone won't be enough to entertain your players.
