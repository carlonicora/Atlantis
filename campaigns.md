## What is a campaign

Before starting digging into the "how to create an incredible story" part, you need to understand what a campaign is. The campaign is the overall story your player characters will go through in their journeys. A campaign can last months and it is a collection of short adventures that are tied together by a common thread. If you plan to start a long-lasting game, you should plot a campaign, a story which will span through many sessions with the same underlying path.

## Plotting a Campaign

The main idea behind a great campaign is simple: you should be able to create a compelling, detailed background plot. Now, what many storytellers don't understand about a campaign is that its plot is neither about the player characters nor it is the story the player characters will go through. While this may sound strange, especially after I mentioned that everything should be around your player and their characters, you need to realise one thing. Your player characters only exist in a world, and the way you allow them to live is to have a world which can live without them. The campaign is your world without the player characters. It is the background upon which they will become heroes of villains. If you have this plot, you can allow them to interact with an exciting world.

Moreover, when you consider this plot, we find it is always best to write it from a villain perspective. While you can write a plot from the perspective of an ally, this does not give your player characters enough interesting spots to interact with the plot. The campaign is, therefore, a long story arc about a villain and what they want to achieve.

Put your thinking cap on, forget any player and start planning what your world will go through in the next months.

## The master plot

The master plot is a simple sentence that identifies, without describing any details, the main villain and its goal.

Don't expect your master plot to tell you more than what's necessary. The first version of your plot does not even have to be interesting. A master plot is just the baseline of what the world will go through.

The plot is a sentence which identifies who the main villain of the story is and what they want to achieve. I found beneficial to add which main challenges they face on their way.

## The story is a collection of information

A common pitfall some storytellers make, is to think that they can grow the story and learn about it at the same time the players do. Imagine yourself as the writer of an intriguing spy story. You, the writer, must know everything about the story. Starting to write the novel without knowing the ins and outs, the who's who is a path to failure. In the same way, as a storyteller, you should know everything concerning your campaign.

## Know everything and everyone in your plot

Now that your master plot, that simple sentence, is ready, it is time to put it in context. This means starting reading your master plot and stopping and clarifying, every time you can, the following:

- What
- Who
- Where
- When
- How

This means that starting from the main plot, every time you meet a detail which is not obvious, you should write some details. These notes will contain other details. You you should clarify those in the same way. This becomes a '*fishbone*' set of answers which will help you describe your campaign in great details.

By starting from a single master plot and by exploring all the details will begin creating your world in minute details. This is what you want because by spending a few hours (or a few days) on refining the initial plot, you will detail your world so much so that moving forward and starting to plan how your player characters will interact with it will be simple.

## How to make a campaign come to life

A campaign, for what you have written so far, is just a master plot with a lot of details. It is time to start planning how to make this come to life and how to let player characters interact with it. The reality is that a campaign is just a list of adventures. And not complete adventures, but adventures ideas. Once you have the master plot, you need to ask yourself: what are the steps the villain or their henchmen need to go through in order to succeed?

Remember, what you need to write are just a set of titles and some notes to make you remember what the title is about! Also, you need to keep in mind the golden rule of a good game master: You must embrace change for your players' sake. While you will spend hours plotting and writing, it is their prerogative to decide how to interact with your creation. Trying to force a story down your player's throat is merely wrong.

Everything you are writing now is just an idea. You still don't know your player characters, their backstories and their dreams. You have no idea how their future actions will impact the villain's plot. This is why your plot and its collection of adventures should still be just an idea. You will change your plot adventures ideas many times, and you should understand that this is the life of a good campaign. There is nothing worse than a game master who can't conceive that their players may not be interested in the order of Scenes.

Another thing to consider is that your list of adventures should not contain just elements which are related to the campaign plot.
